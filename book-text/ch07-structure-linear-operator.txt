2) The elementary divisors and invariant factors of a matrix ( are the
elementary divisors and invariant factors, respectively, of the multiplication
operator ( :
ElemDiv²(³ ~ ElemDiv²( ³

and

InvFact²(³ ~ InvFact²( ³

We emphasize that the elementary divisors and invariant factors of an operator
or matrix are monic by definition. Thus, we no longer need to worry about
uniqueness up to associate.
Theorem 7.6 (The primary cyclic decomposition theorem for = ³ Let = be
finite-dimensional and let   B²= ³ have minimal polynomial

 -invariant subspace of = and the minimal polynomial of  O= is
min² O= ³ ~  ²%³
2) (Cyclic decomposition) Each primary summand = can be decomposed

Recall that if = ~ ( l ) and if both ( and ) are  -invariant subspaces of = ,
the pair ²(Á )³ is said to reduce  . In module language, the pair ²(Á )³ reduces
 if ( and ) are submodules of = and
= ~ ( l )
We can now translate Theorem 6.15 into the current context.
Theorem 7.7 Let   B²= ³ and let
= ~ ( l )
1) The minimal polynomial of  is
 ²%³ ~ lcm² O( ²%³Á  O) ²%³³
2) The primary cyclic decomposition of = is the direct sum of the primary

3) The elementary divisors of  are

The Characteristic Polynomial
To continue our translation project, we need a definition. Recall that in the
characterization of cyclic modules in Theorem 6.17, we made reference to the
product of the elementary divisors, one from each associate class. Now that we
have singled out a special representative from each associate class, we can make
a useful definition.
Definition Let   B²= ³. The characteristic polynomial  ²%³ of  is the
product of all of the elementary divisors of  :


 ²%³ ~   Á ²%³
Á

Hence,
deg² ²%³³ ~ dim²= ³
Similarly, the characteristic polynomial 4 ²%³ of a matrix 4 is the product of
the elementary divisors of 4 .
The following theorem describes the relationship between the minimal and
characteristic polynomials.
Theorem 7.8 Let   B²= ³.
1) (The Cayley–Hamilton theorem) The minimal polynomial of  divides the
characteristic polynomial of  :
 ²%³   ²%³
Equivalently,  satisfies its own characteristic polynomial, that is,
 ² ³ ~ 
2) The minimal polynomial


 ²%³ ~ Á ²%³ÄÁ ²%³
and characteristic polynomial


 ²%³ ~   Á ²%³
Á

of  have the same set of prime factors  ²%³ and hence the same set of
roots (not counting multiplicity).
We have seen that the multiset of elementary divisors forms a complete
invariant for similarity. The reader should construct an example to show that the
pair ² ²%³Á  ²%³³ is not a complete invariant for similarity, that is, this pair of

The Structure of a Linear Operator

171

polynomials does not uniquely determine the multiset of elementary divisors of
the operator  .
In general, the minimal polynomial of a linear operator is hard to find. One of
the virtues of the characteristic polynomial is that it is comparatively easy to
find and we will discuss this in detail a bit later in the chapter.
Note that since  ²%³   ²%³ and both polynomials are monic, it follows that
 ²%³ ~  ²%³

¯

deg² ²%³³ ~ deg² ²%³³

Definition A linear operator   B²= ³ is nonderogatory if its minimal
polynomial is equal to its characteristic polynomial:
 ²%³ ~  ²%³
or equivalently, if
deg² ²%³³ ~ deg² ²%³³
or if
deg² ²%³³ ~ dim²= ³
Similar statements hold for matrices.

Cyclic and Indecomposable Modules
We have seen (Theorem 6.17) that cyclic submodules can be characterized by
their elementary divisors. Let us translate this theorem into the language of =
(and add one more equivalence related to the characteristic polynomial).
Theorem 7.9 Let   B²= ³ have minimal polynomial
 ²%³ ~  ²%³Ä ²%³
where  ²%³ are distinct monic primes. The following are equivalent:
1) = is cyclic.
2) = is the direct sum
= ~ ºº# »» l Ä l ºº# »»
of  -cyclic submodules ºº# »» of order  ²%³.
3) The elementary divisors of  are
ElemDiv² ³ ~ ¸ ²%³Á Ã Á  ²%³¹
4)  is nonderogatory, that is,
 ²%³ ~  ²%³

172

Advanced Linear Algebra

Indecomposable Modules
We have also seen (Theorem 6.19) that, in the language of = , each prime factor
²%³ of the minimal polynomial  ²%³ gives rise to a cyclic submodule > of =
of prime order ²%³.
Theorem 7.10 Let   B²= ³ and let ²%³ be a prime factor of  ²%³. Then =
has a cyclic submodule > of prime order ²%³.
For a module of prime order, we have the following.
Theorem 7.11 For a module > of prime order  ²%³, the following are
equivalent:
1) > is cyclic
2) > is indecomposable
3)  ²%³ is irreducible
4)  is nonderogatory, that is,  ²%³ ~  ²%³
5) dim²> ³ ~ deg²²%³³.
Our translation project is now complete and we can begin to look at issues that
are specific to the modules = .

Companion Matrices
We can also characterize the cyclic modules = via the matrix representations of
the operator  , which is obviously something that we could not do for arbitrary
modules. Let = ~ ºº#»» be a cyclic module, with order
 ²%³ ~  b  % b Ä b c %c b %
and ordered  -cyclic basis

Note that companion matrices are defined only for monic polynomials.
Companion matrices are nonderogatory. Also, companion matrices are precisely
the matrices that represent operators on  -cyclic subspaces.
Theorem 7.12 Let ²%³  - ´%µ.
1) A companion matrix ( ~ *´²%³µ is nonderogatory; in fact,
( ²%³ ~ ( ²%³ ~ ²%³
2) = is cyclic if and only if  can be represented by a companion matrix, in
which case the representing basis is  -cyclic.
Proof. For part 1), let ; ~ ² Á Ã Á  ³ be the standard basis for -  . Since

since ; is linearly independent. Hence, ²%³ has smallest degree among all
polynomials satisfied by ( and so ²%³ ~ ( ²%³. Finally,
deg²( ²%³³ ~ deg²²%³³ ~ deg²( ²%³³
For part 2), we have already proved that if = is cyclic with  -cyclic basis 8 ,
then ´ µ8 ~ *´²%³µ. For the converse, if ´ µ8 ~ *´²%³µ, then part 1) implies
that  is nonderogatory. Hence, Theorem 7.11 implies that = is cyclic. It is
clear from the form of *´²%³µ that 8 is a  -cyclic basis for = .

The Big Picture
If Á   B²= ³, then Theorem 7.2 and the fact that the elementary divisors form
a complete invariant for isomorphism imply that


¯

=  =

¯

ElemDiv² ³ ~ ElemDiv²³

Hence, the multiset of elementary divisors is a complete invariant for similarity
of operators. Of course, the same is true for matrices:
()

¯

-(  -)

¯

ElemDiv²(³ ~ ElemDiv²)³

where we write -( in place of -( .
The connection between the elementary divisors of an operator  and the
elementary divisors of the matrix representations of  is described as follows. If
( ~ ´ µ8 , then the coordinate map 8 ¢ =  -  is also a module isomorphism
8 ¢ = ¦ -( . Specifically, we have
8 ²² ³#³ ~ ´² ³#µ8 ~ ²´ µ8 ³´#µ8 ~ ²(³8 ²#³
and so 8 preserves - ´%µ-scalar multiplication. Hence,
( ~ ´ µ8 for some 8

¬

=  -(

For the converse, suppose that ¢ =  -( . If we define   = by  ~  ,
where  is the th standard basis vector, then 8 ~ ² Á Ã Á  ³ is an ordered
basis for = and  ~ 8 is the coordinate map for 8 . Hence, 8 is a module
isomorphism and so
8 ² #³ ~ ( ²8 #³
for all #  = , that is,
´ #µ8 ~ ( ²´#µ8 ³
which shows that ( ~ ´ µ8 .

Figure 7.1 shows that the similarity classes of B²= ³ are in one-to-one

which, in turn, are in one-to-one correspondence with the similarity classes of

We will see shortly that any multiset of prime power polynomials is the multiset
of elementary divisors for some operator (or matrix) and so the third family in

polynomials.

The Rational Canonical Form

decomposition of = ,

is the union of the bases

and so the matrix of  with respect to H is the block diagonal matrix

where the  ²%³ are monic prime polynomials.
Thus, as shown in Figure 7.1, each similarity class I contains at least one matrix
in the elementary divisor form of rational canonical form.
On the other hand, suppose that 4 is a rational canonical matrix

This shows two important things. First, any multiset of prime power

¸ Á ²%³¹. Hence, two matrices in the elementary divisor form of rational
canonical form lie in the same similarity class if and only if they have the same
multiset of elementary divisors. In other words, the elementary divisor form of
rational canonical form is a set of canonical forms for similarity, up to order of
blocks on the block diagonal.
Theorem 7.14 (The rational canonical form: elementary divisor version) Let

2) Each similarity class I of matrices contains a matrix 9 in the elementary

The rational canonical form may be far from the ideal of simplicity that we had
in mind for a set of simple canonical forms. Indeed, the rational canonical form
can be important as a theoretical tool, more so than a practical one.

The Invariant Factor Version
There is also an invariant factor version of the rational canonical form. We
begin with the following simple result.
Theorem 7.15 If ²%³Á ²%³  - ´%µ are relatively prime polynomials, then

Proof. Speaking in general terms, if an  d  matrix ( has minimal
polynomial
 ²%³ ~  ²%³Ä ²%³
of degree equal to the size  of the matrix, then Theorem 7.14 implies that the
elementary divisors of ( are precisely
 ²%³Á Ã Á  ²%³
Since the matrices *´²%³²%³µ and diag²*´²%³µÁ *´²%³µ³ have the same size
 d  and the same minimal polynomial ²%³²%³ of degree , it follows that
they have the same multiset of elementary divisors and so are similar.

Theorem 7.15 can be used to rearrange and combine the companion matrices in
an elementary divisor version of a rational canonical form 9 to produce an
invariant factor version of rational canonical form that is similar to 9 . Also, this
process is reversible.
Theorem 7.16 (The rational canonical form: invariant factor version) Let
dim²= ³  B and suppose that   B²= ³ has minimal polynomial
 ²%³ ~  ²%³Ä ²%³

´ µ8 ~ diag4*´  ²%³µÁ Ã Á *´  ²%³µ5
where the polynomials  ²%³ are the invariant factors of  and
b ²%³   ²%³. This block diagonal matrix is called an invariant factor
version of a rational canonical form of  .
2) Each similarity class I of matrices contains a matrix 9 in the invariant
factor form of rational canonical form. Moreover, the set of matrices in I
that have this form is the set of matrices obtained from 4 by reordering the
block diagonal matrices. Any such matrix is called an invariant factor
verison of a rational canonical form of (.

The Determinant Form of the Characteristic Polynomial
In general, the minimal polynomial of an operator  is hard to find. One of the
virtues of the characteristic polynomial is that it is comparatively easy to find.
This also provides a nice example of the theoretical value of the rational
canonical form.
Let us first take the case of a companion matrix. If ( ~ *´ ²%³µ is the

Lemma 7.17 For any ²%³  - ´%µ,
det²%0 c *´²%³µ³ ~ ²%³
Now suppose that 9 is a matrix in the elementary divisor form of rational
canonical form. Since the determinant of a block diagonal matrix is the product
of the determinants of the blocks on the diagonal, it follows that


det²%0 c 9³ ~   Á ²%³ ~ 9 ²%³
Á

Moreover, if (  9, say ( ~ 7 97 c , then
det²%0 c (³ ~ det²%0 c 7 97 c ³
~ det ´7 ²%0 c 9³7 c µ
~ det²7 ³det²%0 c 9³det²7 c ³
~ det²%0 c 9³
and so
det²%0 c (³ ~ det²%0 c 9³ ~ 9 ²%³ ~ ( ²%³
Hence, the fact that all matrices have a rational canonical form allows us to
deduce the following theorem.
Theorem 7.18 Let   B²= ³. If ( is any matrix that represents  , then
 ²%³ ~ ( ²%³ ~ det²%0 c (³

Changing the Base Field
A change in the base field will generally change the primeness of polynomials
and therefore has an effect on the multiset of elementary divisors. It is perhaps a
surprising fact that a change of base field has no effect on the invariant factors—
hence the adjective invariant.
Theorem 7.19 Let - and 2 be fields with -  2 . Suppose that the elementary
divisors of a matrix (  C ²- ³ are

Hence, 8 is an elementary divisor basis for ( over 2 .

independent. This is equivalent to saying that the invariant factors of a matrix

1) The invariant factors of ( are polynomials over , .
2) Two matrices (Á )  C ²- ³ are similar over - if and only if they are
similar over , .
Proof. Part 1) follows immediately from Theorem 7.19, since using either 7 or
8 to compute invariant factors gives the same result. Part 2) follows from the
fact that two matrices are similar over a given field if and only if they have the
same multiset of invariant factors over that field.

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Unless otherwise noted, we will assume throughout this chapter that all vector
spaces are finite-dimensional.

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
We have seen that for any   B²= ³, the minimal and characteristic
polynomials have the same set of roots (but not generally the same multiset of
roots). These roots are of vital importance.
Let ( ~ ´ µ8 be a matrix that represents  . A scalar   - is a root of the
characteristic polynomial  ²%³ ~ ( ²%³ ~ det²%0 c (³ if and only if
det²0 c (³ ~ 

(8.1)

that is, if and only if the matrix 0 c ( is singular. In particular, if dim²= ³ ~ ,
then (8.1) holds if and only if there exists a nonzero vector %  -  for which
²0 c (³% ~ 
or equivalently,
( % ~  %
If ´#µ8 ~ %, then this is equivalent to
´ µ8 ´#µ8 ~ ´#µ8
or in operator language,
 # ~ #
This prompts the following definition.
Definition Let = be a vector space over a field - and let   B²= ³.
1) A scalar   - is an eigenvalue (or characteristic value) of  if there
exists a nonzero vector #  = for which

186

Advanced Linear Algebra

 # ~ #
In this case, # is called an eigenvector (or characteristic vector) of 
associated with .
2) A scalar   - is an eigenvalue for a matrix ( if there exists a nonzero
column vector % for which
(% ~ %
In this case, % is called an eigenvector (or characteristic vector) for (
associated with .
3) The set of all eigenvectors associated with a given eigenvalue  , together
with the zero vector, forms a subspace of = , called the eigenspace of  and
denoted by ; . This applies to both linear operators and matrices.
4) The set of all eigenvalues of an operator or matrix is called the spectrum
of the operator or matrix. We denote the spectrum of  by Spec² ³.
Theorem 8.1 Let   B²= ³ have minimal polynomial  ²%³ and characteristic
polynomial  ²%³.
1) The spectrum of  is the set of all roots of  ²%³ or of  ²%³, not counting
multiplicity.
2) The eigenvalues of a matrix are invariants under similarity.
3) The eigenspace ; of the matrix ( is the solution space to the homogeneous
system of equations
²0 c (³²%³ ~ 
One way to compute the eigenvalues of a linear operator  is to first represent 
by a matrix ( and then solve the characteristic equation
det²%0 c (³ ~ 
Unfortunately, it is quite likely that this equation cannot be solved when
dim²= ³  . As a result, the art of approximating the eigenvalues of a matrix is
a very important area of applied linear algebra.
The following theorem describes the relationship between eigenspaces and
eigenvectors of distinct eigenvalues.
Theorem 8.2 Suppose that  Á Ã Á  are distinct eigenvalues of a linear
operator   B²= ³.
1) Eigenvectors associated with distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent;
that is, if #  ; , then the set ¸# Á Ã Á # ¹ is linearly independent.
2) The sum ; b Ä b ; is direct; that is, ; l Ä l ; exists.
Proof. For part 1), if ¸# Á Ã Á # ¹ is linearly dependent, then by renumbering if
necessary, we may assume that among all nontrivial linear combinations of

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

these vectors that equal , the equation
 # b Ä b  # ~ 

(8.2)

has the fewest number of terms. Applying  gives
  # b Ä b   # ~ 

(8.3)

Multiplying (8.2) by  and subtracting from (8.3) gives
 ² c  ³# b Ä b  ² c  ³# ~ 
But this equation has fewer terms than (8.2) and so all of its coefficients must
equal . Since the  's are distinct,  ~  for    and so  ~  as well. This
contradiction implies that the # 's are linearly independent.
The next theorem describes the spectrum of a polynomial ² ³ in  .
Theorem 8.3 (The spectral mapping theorem) Let = be a vector space over
an algebraically closed field - . Let   B²= ³ and let ²%³  - ´%µ. Then
Spec²² ³³ ~ ²Spec² ³³ ~ ¸²³    Spec² ³¹
Proof. We leave it as an exercise to show that if  is an eigenvalue of  , then
²³ is an eigenvalue of ² ³. Hence, ²Spec² ³³  Spec²² ³³. For the reverse
inclusion, let   Spec²² ³³, that is,
²² ³ c ³# ~ 
for # £ . If
²%³ c  ~ ²% c  ³ Ä²% c  ³
where   - , then writing this as a product of (not necessarily distinct) linear
factors, we have
² c  ³Ä² c  ³Ä² c  ³Ä² c  ³# ~ 
(The operator   is written  for convenience.) We can remove factors from
the left end of this equation one by one until we arrive at an operator  (perhaps
the identity) for which # £  but ² c  ³# ~ . Then # is an eigenvector
for  with eigenvalue  . But since ² ³ c  ~ , it follows that
 ~ ² ³  ²Spec² ³³. Hence, Spec²² ³³  ²Spec² ³³.

The Trace and the Determinant
Let - be algebraically closed and let (  C ²- ³ have characteristic
polynomial

~ ²% c  ³Ä²% c  ³

where  Á Ã Á  are the eigenvalues of (. Then
( ²%³ ~ det²%0 c (³
and setting % ~  gives
det²(³ ~ c ~ ²c³c  Ä
Hence, if - is algebraically closed then, up to sign, det²(³ is the constant term
of ( ²%³ and the product of the eigenvalues of (, including multiplicity.
The sum of the eigenvalues of a matrix over an algebraically closed field is also
an interesting quantity. Like the determinant, this quantity is one of the
coefficients of the characteristic polynomial (up to sign) and can also be
computed directly from the entries of the matrix, without knowing the
eigenvalues explicitly.
Definition The trace of a matrix (  C ²- ³, denoted by tr²(³, is the sum of
the elements on the main diagonal of (.
Here are the basic propeties of the trace. Proof is left as an exercise.
Theorem 8.4 Let (Á )  C ²- ³.
1) tr²A³ ~  tr²(³, for   - .
2) tr²( b )³ ~ tr²(³ b tr²)³.
3) tr²()³ ~ tr²)(³.
4) tr²()*³ ~ tr²*()³ ~ tr²)*(³. However, tr²()*³ may not equal
tr²(*)³.
5) The trace is an invariant under similarity.
6) If - is algebraically closed, then tr²(³ is the sum of the eigenvalues of (,
