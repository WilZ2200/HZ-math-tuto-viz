planes º3 » and º3 » have the property that their intersection is a line through
the origin, even if the lines are parallel. We are now ready to define projective
geometries.
Let = be a vector space of any dimension and let / be a hyperplane in = not
containing the origin. To each flat ? in / , we associate the subspace º?» of =
generated by ? . Thus, the linear span function 7 ¢ 7²/³ ¦ I ²= ³ maps affine
subspaces ? of / to subspaces º?» of = . The span function is not surjective:
Its image is the set of all subspaces that are not contained in the base subspace
2 of the flat / .
The linear span function is one-to-one and its inverse is intersection with / ,
7 c < ~ < q /
for any subspace < not contained in 2 .
The affine geometry 7²/³ is, as we have remarked, somewhat incomplete. In
the case dim²/³ ~ , every pair of points determines a line but not every pair
of lines determines a point.
Now, since the linear span function 7 is injective, we can identify 7²/³ with
its image 7 ²7²/³³, which is the set of all subspaces of = not contained in the
base subspace 2 . This view of 7²/³ allows us to “complete” 7²/³ by
including the base subspace 2 . In the three-dimensional case of Figure 16.1, the
base plane, in effect, adds a projective line at infinity. With this inclusion, every
pair of lines intersects, parallel lines intersecting at a point on the line at infinity.
This two-dimensional projective geometry is called the projective plane.
Definition Let = be a vector space. The set I ²= ³ of all subspaces of = is
called the projective geometry of = . The projective dimension pdim²:³ of
:  I ²= ³ is defined as
pdim²:³ ~ dim²:³ c 
The projective dimension of F²= ³ is defined to be pdim²= ³ ~ dim²= ³ c . A
subspace of projective dimension  is called a projective point and a subspace
of projective dimension  is called a projective line.
Thus, referring to Figure 16.1, a projective point is a line through the origin and,
provided that it is not contained in the base plane 2 , it meets / in an affine
point. Similarly, a projective line is a plane through the origin and, provided that
it is not 2 , it will meet / in an affine line. In short,
span²affine point³ ~ line through the origin ~ projective point
span²affine line³ ~ plane through the origin ~ projective line
The linear span function has the following properties.

Theorem 16.12 The linear span function 7 ¢ 7²/³ ¦ I ²= ³ from the affine
geometry 7²/³ to the projective geometry I ²= ³ defined by 7 ? ~ º?»
satisfies the following properties:
1) The linear span function is injective, with inverse given by
7 c < ~ < q /
for all subspaces < not contained in the base subspace 2 of / .
2) The image of the span function is the set of all subspaces of = that are not
contained in the base subspace 2 of / .

Since the reverse inclusion is clear, we have

This establishes 1).
To prove 2), let < be a subspace of = that is not contained in 2 . We wish to
show that < is in the image of the linear span function. Note first that since

The matrix version of the previous discussion leads to the well-known singularvalue decomposition of a matrix. Let (  CÁ ²- ³ and let 8 ~ ²" Á Ã Á " ³

number of 's. Hence, ' is uniquely determined by (, up to the order of the
diagonal elements.

Advanced Linear Algebra

We state without proof the following uniqueness facts and refer the reader to
[48] for details. If    and if the eigenvalues  are distinct, then 7 is
uniquely determined up to multiplication on the right by a diagonal matrix of the
form + ~ diag²' Á Ã Á ' ³ with (' ( ~ . If   , then 8 is never uniquely
determined. If  ~  ~ , then for any given 7 there is a unique 8. Thus, we
see that, in general, the singular-value decomposition is not unique.

The Moore–Penrose Generalized Inverse
Singular values lead to a generalization of the inverse of an operator that applies
to all linear transformations. The setup is the same as in Figure 17.1. Referring
to that figure, we are prompted to define a linear transformation  b ¢ = ¦ < by


 b # ~ F 


"

for   
for   

since then
² b  ³Oº" ÁÃÁ" » ~ 
² b  ³Oº"b ÁÃÁ" » ~ 
and
² b ³Oº# ÁÃÁ# » ~ 
² b ³Oº#b ÁÃÁ# » ~ 
Hence, if  ~  ~ , then  b ~  c . The transformation  b is called the
Moore–Penrose generalized inverse or Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse of  .
We abbreviate this as MP inverse.
Note that the composition  b  is the identity on the largest possible subspace of
< on which any composition of the form  could be the identity, namely, the
orthogonal complement of the kernel of  . A similar statement holds for the
composition  b . Hence,  b is as “close” to an inverse for  as is possible.
We have said that if  is invertible, then  b ~  c . More is true: If  is
injective, then  b  ~  and so  b is a left inverse for  . Also, if  is surjective,
then  b is a right inverse for  . Hence the MP inverse  b generalizes the onesided inverses as well.
Here is a characterization of the MP inverse.
Theorem 17.2 Let   B²< Á = ³. The MP inverse  b of  is completely
characterized by the following four properties:
1)  b  ~ 
2)  b  b ~  b
3)  b is Hermitian
4)  b  is Hermitian

Singular Values and the Moore–Penrose Inverse

Proof. We leave it to the reader to show that  b does indeed satisfy conditions
1)–4) and prove only the uniqueness. Suppose that  and  satisfy 1)–4) when
substituted for  b . Then
 ~  
~ ²  ³ i 
~  i i 
~ ²   ³ i  i 
~  i  i  i i 

~ i  i ² ³i
~ i  i  
~   
~  
which shows that  ~ .
The MP inverse can also be defined for matrices. In particular, if (  4Á ²- ³,
then the matrix operator ( has an MP inverse (b . Since this is a linear
transformation from -  to -  , it is just multiplication by a matrix (b ~ ) .
This matrix ) is the MP inverse for ( and is denoted by (b .
Since (b ~ (b and () ~ ( ) , the matrix version of Theorem 17.2 implies
that (b is completely characterized by the four conditions

Least Squares Approximation
Let us now discuss the most important use of the MP inverse. Consider the
system of linear equations
(% ~ #
where (  4Á ²- ³. (As usual, - ~ d or - ~ s.) This system has a solution
if and only if #  im²( ³. If the system has no solution, then it is of considerable
practical importance to be able to solve the system
(% ~ V#
where V# is the unique vector in im²( ³ that is closest to #, as measured by the
unitary (or Euclidean) distance. This problem is called the linear least squares
problem. Any solution to the system (% ~ V# is called a least squares solution
to the system (% ~ #. Put another way, a least squares solution to (% ~ # is a
vector % for which )(% c #) is minimized.
Suppose that $ and ' are least squares solutions to (% ~ #. Then
($ ~ V# ~ ('
and so $ c '  ker²(³. (We will write ( for ( .) Thus, if $ is a particular least
squares solution, then the set of all least squares solutions is $ b ker²(³.
Among all solutions, the most interesting is the solution of minimum norm.
Note that if there is a least squares solution $ that lies in ker²(³ , then for any
'  ker²(³, we have
)$ b ' ) ~ )$) b )' )  )$)
and so $ will be the unique least squares solution of minimum norm.
Before proceeding, we recall (Theorem 9.14) that if : is a subspace of a finitedimensional inner product space = , then the best approximation to a vector
#  = from within : is the unique vector V#  : for which # c V#  : . Now we

This system of equations is called the normal equations for (% ~ #. Its

An Introduction to Algebras

Motivation
We have spent considerable time studying the structure of a linear operator
  B- ²= ³ on a finite-dimensional vector space = over a field - . In our
studies, we defined the - ´%µ-module = and used the decomposition theorems
for modules over a principal ideal domain to dissect this module. We
concentrated on an individual operator  , rather than the entire vector space
B- ²= ³. In fact, we have made relatively little use of the fact that B- ²= ³ is an
algebra under composition. In this chapter, we give a brief introduction to the
theory of algebras, of which B- ²= ³ is the most general, in the sense of Theorem
18.2 below.

Associative Algebras
An algebra is a combination of a ring and a vector space, with an axiom that
links the ring product with scalar multiplication.
Definition An (associative) algebra ( over a field - , or an - -algebra, is a
nonempty set (, together with three operations, called addition (denoted by
b ), multiplication (denoted by juxtaposition) and scalar multiplication (also
denoted by juxtaposition), for which the following properties hold:
1) ( is a vector space over - under addition and scalar multiplication.
2) ( is a ring with identity under addition and multiplication.
3) If   - and Á   (, then
²³ ~ ²³ ~ ²³
An algebra is finite-dimensional if it is finite-dimensional as a vector space. An
algebra is commutative if ( is a commutative ring. An element   ( is
invertible if there is   ( for which  ~  ~ .
Our definition requires that ( have a multiplicative identity. Such algebras are
called unital algebras. Algebras without unit are also of great importance, but

452

Advanced Linear Algebra

we will not study them here. Also, in this chapter, we will assume that all
algebras are associative. Nonassociative algebras, such as Lie algebras and
Jordan algebras, are important as well.

The Center of an Algebra
Definition The center of an - -algebra ( is the set
A²(³ ~ ¸  (  % ~ % for all %  (¹
of all elements of ( that commute with every element of (.
The center of an algebra is never trivial since it contains a copy of - :
¸    - ¹  A²(³
Definition An - -algebra ( is central if its center is as small as possible, that
is, if
A²(³ ~ ¸    - ¹

From a Vector Space to an Algebra
If = is a vector space over a field - and if 8 ~ ¸    0¹ is a basis for = ,
then it is natural to wonder whether we can form an - -algebra simply by
defining a product for the basis elements and then using the distributive laws to
extend the product to = . In particular, we choose a set of constants Á with the
property that for each pair ²Á ³, only finitely many of the Á are nonzero. Then
we set

   ~    
for all Á   0 . The constants Á are called the structure constants for the
algebra (. To get a unital algebra, we can take for a given   0 , the structure
constants to be
Á ~ Á ~ Á
in which case  is the multiplicative identity. (An alternative is to adjoin a new
element to the basis and define its structure constants in this way.)

Examples
The following examples will make it clear why algebras are important.
Example 18.1 If -  , are fields, then , is a vector space over - . This vector
space structure, along with the ring structure of , , is an algebra over - .
Example 18.2 The ring - ´%µ of polynomials is an algebra over - .
Example 18.3 The ring C ²- ³ of all  d  matrices over a field - is an
algebra over - , where scalar multiplication is defined by

Example 18.4 The set B- ²= ³ of all linear operators on a vector space = over a
field - is an - -algebra, where addition is addition of functions, multiplication is
composition of functions and scalar multiplication is given by
²³²#³ ~ ´#µ
The identity map   B- ²= ³ is the multiplicative identity and the zero map
  B- ²= ³ is the additive identity. This algebra is also denoted by End- ²= ³,
since the linear operators on = are also called endomorphisms of = .
Example 18.5 If . is a group and - is a field, then we can form a vector space
- ´.µ over - by taking all formal - -linear combinations of elements of . and
treating . as a basis for - ´.µ. This vector space can be made into an - -algebra
where the structure constants are determined by the group product, that is, if
  ~ " , then Á ~ Á" . The group identity  ~  is the algebra identity
since   ~  and so Á ~ Á and similarly, Á ~ Á .
The resulting associative algebra - ´.µ is called the group algebra over - .
Specifically, the elements of - ´.µ have the form
