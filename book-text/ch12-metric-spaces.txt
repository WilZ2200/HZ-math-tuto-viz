Example 12.7 The space MB is not separable. Recall that MB is the set of all
bounded sequences of real numbers (or complex numbers) with metric
²%Á &³ ~ sup(% c & (


To see that this space is not separable, consider the set : of all binary sequences
: ~ ¸²% ³  % ~  or  for all ¹
This set is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of all subsets of o and so
is uncountable. (It has cardinality 2L  L .³ Now, each sequence in : is
certainly bounded and so lies in MB . Moreover, if % £ &  MB , then the two
sequences must differ in at least one position and so ²%Á &³ ~ .
In other words, we have a subset : of MB that is uncountable and for which the
distance between any two distinct elements is . This implies that the balls in the
uncountable collection ¸)² Á °³   :¹ are mutually disjoint. Hence, no
countable set can meet every ball, which implies that no countable set can be
dense in MB .
Example 12.8 The metric spaces M are separable, for   . The set : of all
sequences of the form
~ ² Á Ã Á  Á Á Ã ³
for all   , where the  's are rational, is a countable set. Let us show that it is
dense in M . Any %  M satisfies

Hence, for any   , there exists an 5 such that

Continuity
Continuity plays a central role in the study of linear operators on infinitedimensional inner product spaces.
Definition Let  ¢ 4 ¦ 4 Z be a function from the metric space ²4 Á ³ to the
metric space ²4 Z Á  Z ³. We say that  is continuous at %  4 if for any   ,
there exists a    such that
²%Á % ³   ¬  Z ² ²%³Á  ²% ³³  
or, equivalently,
 4)²% Á  ³5  )² ²% ³Á ³
(See Figure 12.2.) A function is continuous if it is continuous at every
%  4 .

Figure 12.2
We can use the notion of convergence to characterize continuity for functions
between metric spaces.
Theorem 12.4 A function  ¢ 4 ¦ 4 Z is continuous if and only if whenever
²% ³ is a sequence in 4 that converges to %  4 , then the sequence ² ²% ³³
converges to  ²% ³, in short,
²% ³ ¦ % ¬ ² ²% ³³ ¦  ²% ³
Proof. Suppose first that  is continuous at % and let ²% ³ ¦ % . Then, given
  , the continuity of  implies the existence of a    such that
 ²)²% Á  ³³  )² ²% ³Á ³
Since ²% ³ ¦ %, there exists an 5   such that %  )²% Á  ³ for   5 and
so
  5 ¬  ²% ³  )² ²% ³Á ³
Thus,  ²% ³ ¦  ²% ³.
Conversely, suppose that ²% ³ ¦ % implies ² ²% ³³ ¦  ²% ³. Suppose, for the
purposes of contradiction, that  is not continuous at % . Then there exists an

and so we may construct a sequence ²% ³ by choosing each term % with the
property that

Hence, ²% ³ ¦ % , but  ²% ³ does not converge to  ²% ³. This contradiction
implies that  must be continuous at % .
The next theorem says that the distance function is a continuous function in both
variables.
Theorem 12.5 Let ²4 Á ³ be a metric space. If ²% ³ ¦ % and ²& ³ ¦ &, then
²% Á & ³ ¦ ²%Á &³.
Proof. We leave it as an exercise to show that
(²% Á & ³ c ²%Á &³(  ²% Á %³ b ²& Á &³
But the right side tends to  as  ¦ B and so ²% Á & ³ ¦ ²%Á &³.

Completeness
The reader who has studied analysis will recognize the following definitions.
Definition A sequence ²% ³ in a metric space 4 is a Cauchy sequence if for
any   , there exists an 5   for which
Á   5 ¬ ²% Á % ³  
We leave it to the reader to show that any convergent sequence is a Cauchy
sequence. When the converse holds, the space is said to be complete.
Definition Let 4 be a metric space.
1) 4 is said to be complete if every Cauchy sequence in 4 converges in 4 .
2) A subspace : of 4 is complete if it is complete as a metric space. Thus, :
is complete if every Cauchy sequence ²  ³ in : converges to an element in
:.
Before considering examples, we prove a very useful result about completeness
of subspaces.

312

Advanced Linear Algebra

Theorem 12.6 Let 4 be a metric space.
1) Any complete subspace of 4 is closed.
2) If 4 is complete, then a subspace : of 4 is complete if and only if it is
closed.
Proof. To prove 1), assume that : is a complete subspace of 4 . Let ²% ³ be a
sequence in : for which ²% ³ ¦ %  4 . Then ²% ³ is a Cauchy sequence in :
and since : is complete, ²% ³ must converge to an element of : . Since limits of
sequences are unique, we have %  : . Hence, : is closed.
To prove part 2), first assume that : is complete. Then part 1) shows that : is
closed. Conversely, suppose that : is closed and let ²% ³ be a Cauchy sequence
in : . Since ²% ³ is also a Cauchy sequence in the complete space 4 , it must
converge to some %  4 . But since : is closed, we have ²% ³ ¦ %  : . Hence,
: is complete.
Now let us consider some examples of complete (and incomplete) metric spaces.
Example 12.9 It is well known that the metric space s is complete. (However, a
proof of this fact would lead us outside the scope of this book.³ Similarly, the
complex numbers d are complete.
Example 12.10 The Euclidean space s and the unitary space d are complete.
Let us prove this for s . Suppose that ²% ³ is a Cauchy sequence in s , where
% ~ ²%Á Á Ã Á %Á ³
Thus,


²% Á % ³ ~ ²%Á c %Á ³ ¦  as Á  ¦ B
~

and so, for each coordinate position ,
²%Á c %Á ³  ²% Á % ³ ¦ 
which shows that the sequence ²%Á ³~Á2ÁÃ of th coordinates is a Cauchy
sequence in s. Since s is complete, we must have
²%Á ³ ¦ & as  ¦ B
If & ~ ²& Á Ã Á & ³, then


²% Á &³ ~ ²%Á c & ³ ¦  as  ¦ B

and so ²% ³ ¦ &  s . This proves that s is complete.

Example 12.11 The metric space ²*´Á µÁ ³ of all real-valued (or complexvalued) continuous functions on ´Á µ, with metric
² Á ³ ~ sup ( ²%³ c ²%³(
%´Áµ

uniform limit on ´Á µ, that is ² Á  ³ ¦  if and only if for any   , there is
an 5   for which
  5 ¬ ( ²%³ c  ²%³(   for all %  ´Á µ

an 5 for which
Á   5 ¬ ( ²%³ c  ²%³(   for all %  ´Á µ

(12.1)

This implies that, for each %  ´Á µ, the sequence ² ²%³³ is a Cauchy sequence
of real (or complex) numbers and so it converges. We can therefore define a
function  on ´Á µ by
 ²%³ ~ lim  ²%³

Letting  ¦ B in (12.1), we get
  5 ¬ ( ²%³ c  ²%³(   for all %  ´Á µ

² ²%³³ ¦  ²%³  *´Á µ and so ²*´Á µÁ ³ is complete.

We leave it to the reader to show that the sequence ² ²%³³ is Cauchy, but does
not converge in ²*´Á µÁ  ³. (The sequence converges to a function that is not
continuous.)
Example 12.13 The metric space MB is complete. To see this, suppose that ²% ³

As we will see in the next chapter, the property of completeness plays a major
role in the theory of inner product spaces. Inner product spaces for which the
induced metric space is complete are called Hilbert spaces.

Isometries
A function between two metric spaces that preserves distance is called an
isometry. Here is the formal definition.
Definition Let ²4 Á ³ and ²4 Z Á  Z ³ be metric spaces. A function  ¢ 4 ¦ 4 Z is
called an isometry if
 Z ² ²%³Á  ²&³³ ~ ²%Á &³

316

Advanced Linear Algebra

for all %Á &  4 . If  ¢ 4 ¦ 4 Z is a bijective isometry from 4 to 4 Z , we say
that 4 and 4 Z are isometric and write 4  4 Z .
Theorem 12.7 Let  ¢ ²4 Á ³ ¦ ²4 Z Á  Z ³ be an isometry. Then
1)  is injective
2)  is continuous
3)  c ¢  ²4 ³ ¦ 4 is also an isometry and hence also continuous.
Proof. To prove 1), we observe that
 ²%³ ~  ²&³ ¯  Z ² ²%³Á  ²&³³ ~  ¯ ²%Á &³ ~  ¯ % ~ &
To prove 2), let ²% ³ ¦ % in 4 . Then
 Z ² ²% ³Á  ²%³³ ~ ²% Á %³ ¦  as  ¦ B
and so ² ²% ³³ ¦  ²%³, which proves that  is continuous. Finally, we have
² c ² ²%³³Á  c ² ²&³³ ~ ²%Á &³ ~  Z ² ²%³Á  ²&³³
and so  c ¢  ²4 ³ ¦ 4 is an isometry.

The Completion of a Metric Space
While not all metric spaces are complete, any metric space can be embedded in
a complete metric space. To be more specific, we have the following important
theorem.
Theorem 12.8 Let ²4 Á ³ be any metric space. Then there is a complete metric
space ²4 Z Á  Z ³ and an isometry  ¢ 4 ¦  4  4 Z for which  4 is dense in
4 Z . The metric space ²4 Z Á  Z ³ is called a completion of ²4 Á ³. Moreover,
²4 Z Á  Z ³ is unique, up to bijective isometry.
Proof. The proof is a bit lengthy, so we divide it into various parts. We can
simplify the notation considerably by thinking of sequences ²% ³ in 4 as
functions  ¢ o ¦ 4 , where  ²³ ~ % .

Cauchy Sequences in 4
The basic idea is to let the elements of 4 Z be equivalence classes of Cauchy
sequences in 4 . So let CS²4 ³ denote the set of all Cauchy sequences in 4 . If
 Á   CS²4 ³, then, intuitively speaking, the terms  ²³ get closer together as
 ¦ B and so do the terms ²³. Therefore, it seems reasonable that
² ²³Á ²³³ should approach a finite limit as  ¦ B. Indeed, since
(² ²³Á ²³³ c ² ²³Á ²³³(  ² ²³Á  ²³³ b ²²³Á ²³³ ¦ 
as Á  ¦ B it follows that ² ²³Á ²³³ is a Cauchy sequence of real
numbers, which implies that

(That is, the limit exists and is finite.³

Equivalence Classes of Cauchy Sequences in 4
We would like to define a metric  Z on the set CS²4 ³ by
 Z ² Á ³ ~ lim ² ²³Á ²³³
¦B

However, it is possible that
lim ² ²³Á ²³³ ~ 

¦B

for distinct sequences  and , so this does not define a metric. Thus, we are led
to define an equivalence relation on CS²4 ³ by
   ¯ lim ² ²³Á ²³³ ~ 
¦B

Let CS²4 ³ be the set of all equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences and
define, for  Á   CS²4 ³,

(12.5)

where    and   .
To see that  Z is well-defined, suppose that  Z   and Z  . Then since
 Z   and Z  , we have
(² Z ²³Á Z ²³³ c ² ²³Á ²³³(  ² Z ²³Á  ²³³ b ²Z ²³Á ²³³ ¦ 

sequences, then
² ²³Á ²³³  ² ²³Á ²³³ b ²²³Á ²³³

Embedding ²4 Á ³ in ²4 Z Á  Z ³
For each %  4 , consider the constant Cauchy sequence ´%µ, where ´%µ²³ ~ %

% ~ ´%µ
is an isometry, since
 Z ² %Á  &³ ~  Z ²´%µÁ ´&µ³ ~ lim ²´%µ²³Á ´&µ²³³ ~ ²%Á &³
¦B

Moreover, 4 is dense in 4 Z . This follows from the fact that we can
approximate any Cauchy sequence in 4 by a constant sequence. In particular,
let   4 Z . Since    is a Cauchy sequence, for any   , there exists an 5
such that

We can think of  as a constant approximation to  , with error at most ° .
Let  be the sequence of these constant approximations:
²³ ~ 
This is a Cauchy sequence in 4 . Intuitively speaking, since the  's get closer

have
² Á  ³ ~  Z ²´ µÁ ´ µ³

Uniqueness
Finally, we must show that if ²4 Z Á  Z ³ and ²4 ZZ Á  ZZ ³ are both completions of
²4 Á ³, then 4 Z  4 ZZ . Note that we have bijective isometries
 ¢ 4 ¦  4  4 Z and ¢ 4 ¦ 4  4 ZZ
Hence, the map
 ~  c ¢  4 ¦ 4
is a bijective isometry from  4 onto 4 , where  4 is dense in 4 Z . ²See
Figure 12.4.³

320

Figure 12.4
Our goal is to show that  can be extended to a bijective isometry  from 4 Z to
4 ZZ .
Let %  4 Z . Then there is a sequence ² ³ in  4 for which ² ³ ¦ %. Since
² ³ is a Cauchy sequence in  4 , ²² ³³ is a Cauchy sequence in 4  4 ZZ
and since 4 ZZ is complete, we have ²² ³³ ¦ & for some &  4 ZZ . Let us
define ²%³ ~ &.
To see that  is well-defined, suppose that ² ³ ¦ % and ² ³ ¦ %, where both
sequences lie in 4 . Then
 ZZ ²² ³Á ² ³³ ~  Z ² Á  ³ ¦  as  ¦ B
and so ²² ³³ and ²² ³³ converge to the same element of 4 ZZ , which implies
that ²%³ does not depend on the choice of sequence in  4 converging to %.
Thus,  is well-defined. Moreover, if    4 , then the constant sequence ´µ
converges to  and so ²³ ~ lim ²³ ~ ²³, which shows that  is an
extension of .
To see that  is an isometry, suppose that ² ³ ¦ % and ² ³ ¦ &. Then
²² ³³ ¦ ²%³ and ²² ³³ ¦ ²&³ and since  ZZ is continuous, we have
 ZZ ²²%³Á ²&³³ ~ lim  ZZ ²² ³Á ² ³³ ~ lim  Z ²Á ³ ~  Z ²%Á &³
¦B

¦B

Thus, we need only show that  is surjective. Note first that
4 ~ im²³  im²³. Thus, if im²³ is closed, we can deduce from the fact
that 4 is dense in 4 ZZ that im²³ ~ 4 ZZ . So, suppose that ²²% ³³ is a
sequence in im²³ and ²²% ³³ ¦ ' . Then ²²% ³³ is a Cauchy sequence and
therefore so is ²% ³. Thus, ²% ³ ¦ %  4 Z . But  is continuous and so
²²% ³³ ¦ ²%³, which implies that ²%³ ~ ' and so '  im²³. Hence,  is
surjective and 4 Z  4 ZZ .

Hilbert Spaces

Now that we have the necessary background on the topological properties of
metric spaces, we can resume our study of inner product spaces without
qualification as to dimension. As in Chapter 9, we restrict attention to real and
complex inner product spaces. Hence - will denote either s or d.

A Brief Review
Let us begin by reviewing some of the results from Chapter 9. Recall that an
inner product space = over - is a vector space = , together with an inner
product ºÁ »¢ = d = ¦ - . If - ~ s, then the inner product is bilinear and if
- ~ d, the inner product is sesquilinear.
An inner product induces a norm on = , defined by
)#) ~ jº#Á #»
We recall in particular the following properties of the norm.
Theorem 13.1
1) (The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality) For all "Á #  = ,
(º"Á #»(  )") )#)
with equality if and only if " ~ # for some   - .
2) (The triangle inequality) For all "Á #  = ,

with equality if and only if " ~ # for some   - .
3) (The parallelogram law)
)" b #) b )" c #) ~ )") b )#)
We have seen that the inner product can be recovered from the norm, as follows.

The inner product also induces a metric on = defined by
²"Á #³ ~ )" c #)
Thus, any inner product space is a metric space.
Definition Let = and > be inner product spaces and let   B²= Á > ³.
1)  is an isometry if it preserves the inner product, that is, if
º "Á  #» ~ º"Á #»
for all "Á #  = .
2) A bijective isometry is called an isometric isomorphism. When ¢ = ¦ >
is an isometric isomorphism, we say that = and > are isometrically
isomorphic.
It is easy to see that an isometry is always injective but need not be surjective,
even if = ~ > .
Theorem 13.3 A linear transformation   B²= Á > ³ is an isometry if and only
if it preserves the norm, that is, if and only if
)#) ~ )#)

The following result points out one of the main differences between real and
complex inner product spaces.
Theorem 13.4 Let = be an inner product space and let   B²= ³.
1) If º #Á $» ~  for all #Á $  = , then  ~ .
2) If = is a complex inner product space and 8 ²#³ ~ º #Á #» ~  for all
#  = , then  ~ .
3) Part 2) does not hold in general for real inner product spaces.

Hilbert Spaces
Since an inner product space is a metric space, all that we learned about metric
spaces applies to inner product spaces. In particular, if ²% ³ is a sequence of

Hilbert Spaces

327

vectors in an inner product space = , then
²% ³ ¦ % if and only if )% c %) ¦  as  ¦ B
The fact that the inner product is continuous as a function of either of its
coordinates is extremely useful.
Theorem 13.5 Let = be an inner product space. Then
1) ²% ³ ¦ %Á ²& ³ ¦ & ¬ º% Á & » ¦ º%Á &»
2) ²% ³ ¦ % ¬ )% ) ¦ )%)
Complete inner product spaces play an especially important role in both theory
and practice.
Definition An inner product space that is complete under the metric induced by
the inner product is said to be a Hilbert space.
Example 13.1 One of the most important examples of a Hilbert space is the
space M . Recall that the inner product is defined by

which agrees with the definition of the metric space M given in Chapter 12. In
other words, the metric in Chapter 12 is induced by this inner product. As we
saw in Chapter 12, this inner product space is complete and so it is a Hilbert
space. (In fact, it is the prototype of all Hilbert spaces, introduced by David
Hilbert in 1912, even before the axiomatic definition of Hilbert space was given
by John von Neumann in 1927.³
The previous example raises the question whether the other metric spaces M

are complete inner product spaces. The fact is that they are not even inner
product spaces! More specifically, there is no inner product whose induced
metric is given by (13.1). To see this, observe that, according to Theorem 13.1,

328

Advanced Linear Algebra

any norm that comes from an inner product must satisfy the parallelogram law
) % b & )  b ) % c & )  ~  ) % )  b  )& ) 
But the norm in (13.1) does not satisfy this law. To see this, take

)% b &) ~ Á )% c &) ~ 

Thus, the left side of the parallelogram law is
which equals if and only if  ~ .

and the right side is  h 2° ,

Just as any metric space has a completion, so does any inner product space.
Theorem 13.6 Let = be an inner product space. Then there exists a Hilbert
space / and an isometry  ¢ = ¦ / for which  = is dense in / . Moreover, /
is unique up to isometric isomorphism.
Proof. We know that the metric space ²= Á ³, where  is induced by the inner
product, has a unique completion ²= Z Á  Z ³, which consists of equivalence classes
of Cauchy sequences in = . If ²% ³  ²% ³  = Z and ²& ³  ²& ³  = Z , then we
set
²% ³ b ²& ³ ~ ²% b & ³Á ²% ³ ~ ²% ³
and
º²% ³Á ²& ³» ~ lim º% Á & »
¦B

It is easy to see that since ²% ³ and ²& ³ are Cauchy sequences, so are ²% b & ³
and ²% ³. In addition, these definitions are well-defined, that is, they are
independent of the choice of representative from each equivalence class. For
instance, if ²%
V ³  ²% ³, then
lim )% c %
V ) ~ 

¦B

and so
(º% Á & » c º%
V Á & »( ~ (º% c %
V Á & »(  )% c %
V ))& ) ¦ 
(The Cauchy sequence ²& ³ is bounded.³ Hence,
º²% ³Á ²& ³» ~ lim º% Á & » ~ lim º%
V Á & » ~ º²%
V³Á ²&³»
¦B

¦B

We leave it to the reader to show that = Z is an inner product space under these
operations.

Moreover, the inner product on = Z induces the metric  Z , since
º²% c & ³Á ²% c & ³» ~ lim º% c & Á % c &»
¦B

~ lim ²% Á & ³
¦B

~  Z ²²% ³Á ²& ³³
Hence, the metric space isometry ¢ = ¦ = Z is an isometry of inner product
spaces, since
º %Á  &» ~  Z ² %Á  &³ ~ ²%Á &³ ~ º%Á &»
Thus, = Z is a complete inner product space and  = is a dense subspace of = Z
that is isometrically isomorphic to = . We leave the issue of uniqueness to the
reader.
The next result concerns subspaces of inner product spaces.
Theorem 13.7
1) Any complete subspace of an inner product space is closed.
2) A subspace of a Hilbert space is a Hilbert space if and only if it is closed.
3) Any finite-dimensional subspace of an inner product space is closed and
complete.
Proof. Parts 1) and 2) follow from Theorem 12.6. Let us prove that a finitedimensional subspace : of an inner product space = is closed. Suppose that
²% ³ is a sequence in : , ²% ³ ¦ % and % ¤ : . Let 8 ~ ¸ Á Ã Á  ¹ be an
orthonormal Hamel basis for : . The Fourier expansion

~ º%Á  »
~

in : has the property that % c £  but
º% c Á  » ~ º%Á  » c º Á  » ~ 
Thus, if we write & ~ % c and & ~ % c  : , the sequence ²& ³, which is
in : , converges to a vector & that is orthogonal to : . But this is impossible,
because &  & implies that
)& c &) ~ )& ) b )&)  )&) ¦
° 
This proves that : is closed.
To see that any finite-dimensional subspace : of an inner product space is
complete, let us embed : (as an inner product space in its own right) in its
completion : Z . Then : (or rather an isometric copy of : ) is a finite-dimensional

330

Advanced Linear Algebra

subspace of a complete inner product space : Z and as such it is closed.
However, : is dense in : Z and so : ~ : Z , which shows that : is complete.

Infinite Series
Since an inner product space allows both addition of vectors and convergence of
sequences, we can define the concept of infinite sums, or infinite series.
Definition Let = be an inner product space. The th partial sum of the
sequence ²% ³ in = is
 ~ % b Ä b % 

If the sequence ²  ³ of partial sums converges to a vector  = , that is, if
)  c ) ¦  as  ¦ B
then we say that the series  % converges to and write
B

 % ~
~

We can also define absolute convergence.
Definition A series  % is said to be absolutely convergent if the series
B

)% )
~

converges.
The key relationship between convergence and absolute convergence is given in
the next theorem. Note that completeness is required to guarantee that absolute
convergence implies convergence.
Theorem 13.8 Let = be an inner product space. Then = is complete if and only
if absolute convergence of a series implies convergence.
Proof. Suppose that = is complete and that )% )  B. Then the sequence 
of partial sums is a Cauchy sequence, for if   , we have




)  c  ) ~ i  % i   )% ) ¦ 
~b

~b

Hence, the sequence ²  ³ converges, that is, the series  % converges.
Conversely, suppose that absolute convergence implies convergence and let
²% ³ be a Cauchy sequence in = . We wish to show that this sequence
converges. Since ²% ³ is a Cauchy sequence, for each   , there exists an 5

Clearly, we can choose 5  5  Ä, in which case

Thus, according to hypothesis, the series

converges. But this is a telescoping series, whose th partial sum is
%5b c %5
and so the subsequence ²%5 ³ converges. Since any Cauchy sequence that has a
convergent subsequence must itself converge, the sequence ²% ³ converges and
so = is complete.

An Approximation Problem
Suppose that = is an inner product space and that : is a subset of = . It is of
considerable interest to be able to find, for any %  = , a vector in : that is
closest to % in the metric induced by the inner product, should such a vector
exist. This is the approximation problem for = .
Suppose that %  = and let
