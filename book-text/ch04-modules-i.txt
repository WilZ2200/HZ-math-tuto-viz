Modules I: Basic Properties

The following simple submodules play a special role in the theory.
Definition Let 4 be an 9 -module. A submodule of the form
ºº#»» ~ 9# ~ ¸#    9¹
for #  4 is called the cyclic submodule generated by #.
Of course, any finite-dimensional vector space is the direct sum of cyclic
submodules, that is, one-dimensional subspaces. One of our main goals is to
show that a finitely generated module over a principal ideal domain has this
property as well.
Definition An 9 -module 4 is said to be finitely generated if it contains a
finite set that generates 4 . More specifically, 4 is -generated if it has a
generating set of size  (although it may have a smaller generating set as
well).
Of course, a vector space is finitely generated if and only if it has a finite basis,
that is, if and only if it is finite-dimensional. For modules, life is more
complicated. The following is an example of a finitely generated module that
has a submodule that is not finitely generated.
Example 4.2 Let 9 be the ring - ´% Á % Á Ã µ of all polynomials in infinitely
many variables over a field - . It will be convenient to use ? to denote
% Á % Á Ã and write a polynomial in 9 in the form ²?³. (Each polynomial in
9 , being a finite sum, involves only finitely many variables, however.) Then 9
is an 9 -module and as such, is finitely generated by the identity element
²?³ ~ .
Now consider the submodule : of all polynomials with zero constant term. This
module is generated by the variables themselves,
: ~ ºº% Á % Á Ã »»
However, : is not finitely generated. To see this, suppose that . ~ ¸ Á Ã Á  ¹
is a finite generating set for : . Choose a variable % that does not appear in any
of the polynomials in .. Then no linear combination of the polynomials in .
can be equal to % . For if


% ~  ²?³ ²?³
~

114

Advanced Linear Algebra

then let  ²?³ ~ %  ²?³ b  ²?³ where  ²?³ does not involve % . This gives


% ~ ´%  ²?³ b  ²?³µ ²?³
~




~ %  ²?³ ²?³ b  ²?³ ²?³
~

~

The last sum does not involve % and so it must equal . Hence, the first sum
must equal , which is not possible since  ²?³ has no constant term.

Linear Independence
The concept of linear independence also carries over to modules.
Definition A subset : of an 9 -module 4 is linearly independent if for any
distinct # Á Ã Á #  : and  Á Ã Á   9 , we have
 # b Ä b  # ~  ¬  ~  for all 
A set : that is not linearly independent is linearly dependent.
It is clear from the definition that any subset of a linearly independent set is
linearly independent.
Recall that in a vector space, a set : of vectors is linearly dependent if and only
if some vector in : is a linear combination of the other vectors in : . For
arbitrary modules, this is not true.
Example 4.3 Consider { as a {-module. The elements Á   { are linearly
dependent, since
²³ c ²³ ~ 
but neither one is a linear combination (i.e., integer multiple) of the other.
The problem in the previous example (as noted earlier) is that
 # b Ä b  # ~ 
implies that
 # ~ c  # c Ä c  #
but in general, we cannot divide both sides by  , since it may not have a
multiplicative inverse in the ring 9 .

Torsion Elements
In a vector space = over a field - , singleton sets ¸#¹ where # £  are linearly
independent. Put another way,  £  and # £  imply # £ . However, in a
module, this need not be the case.
Example 4.4 The abelian group { ~ ¸Á Á Ã Á c¹ is a {-module, with
scalar multiplication defined by ' ~ ²' h ³ mod , for all '  { and   { .
However, since  ~  for all   { , no singleton set ¸¹ is linearly
independent. Indeed, { has no linearly independent sets.
This example motivates the following definition.
Definition Let 4 be an 9 -module. A nonzero element #  4 for which # ~ 
for some nonzero   9 is called a torsion element of 4 . A module that has no
nonzero torsion elements is said to be torsion-free. If all elements of 4 are
torsion elements, then 4 is a torsion module. The set of all torsion elements of
4 , together with the zero element, is denoted by 4tor .
If 4 is a module over an integral domain, it is not hard to see that 4tor is a
submodule of 4 and that 4 °4tor is torsion-free. (We will define quotient
modules shortly: they are defined in the same way as for vector spaces.)

Annihilators
Closely associated with the notion of a torsion element is that of an annihilator.
Definition Let 4 be an 9 -module. The annihilator of an element #  4 is
ann²#³ ~ ¸  9  # ~ ¹
and the annihilator of a submodule 5 of 4 is
ann²5 ³ ~ ¸  9  5 ~ ¸¹¹
where 5 ~ ¸#  #  5 ¹. Annihilators are also called order ideals.
It is easy to see that ann²#³ and ann²5 ³ are ideals of 9 . Clearly, #  4 is a
torsion element if and only if ann²#³ £ ¸¹. Also, if ( and ) are submodules of
4 , then
()

¬

ann²)³  ann²(³

(note the reversal of order).
Let 4 ~ ºº" Á Ã Á " »» be a finitely generated module over an integral domain
9 and assume that each of the generators " is torsion, that is, for each , there is
a nonzero   ann²" ³. Then, the nonzero product  ~  Ä annihilates each
generator of 4 and therefore every element of 4 , that is,   ann²4 ³. This

116

Advanced Linear Algebra

shows that ann²4 ³ £ ¸¹. On the other hand, this may fail if 9 is not an
integral domain. Also, there are torsion modules whose annihilators are trivial.
(We leave verification of these statements as an exercise.)

Free Modules
The definition of a basis for a module parallels that of a basis for a vector space.
Definition Let 4 be an 9 -module. A subset 8 of 4 is a basis if 8 is linearly
independent and spans 4 . An 9-module 4 is said to be free if 4 ~ ¸¹ or if
4 has a basis. If 8 is a basis for 4 , we say that 4 is free on 8 .
We have the following analog of part of Theorem 1.7.
Theorem 4.3 A subset 8 of a module 4 is a basis if and only if every nonzero
#  4 is an essentially unique linear combination of the vectors in 8 .
In a vector space, a set of vectors is a basis if and only if it is a minimal
spanning set, or equivalently, a maximal linearly independent set. For modules,
the following is the best we can do in general. We leave proof to the reader.
Theorem 4.4 Let 8 be a basis for an 9 -module 4 . Then
1) 8 is a minimal spanning set.
2) 8 is a maximal linearly independent set.
The {-module { has no basis since it has no linearly independent sets. But
since the entire module is a spanning set, we deduce that a minimal spanning set
need not be a basis. In the exercises, the reader is asked to give an example of a
module 4 that has a finite basis, but with the property that not every spanning
set in 4 contains a basis and not every linearly independent set in 4 is
contained in a basis. It follows in this case that a maximal linearly independent
set need not be a basis.
The next example shows that even free modules are not very much like vector
spaces. It is an example of a free module that has a submodule that is not free.
Example 4.5 The set { d { is a free module over itself, using componentwise
scalar multiplication
²Á ³²Á ³ ~ ²Á ³
with basis ¸²Á ³¹. But the submodule { d ¸¹ is not free since it has no
linearly independent elements and hence no basis.
Theorem 2.2 says that a linear transformation can be defined by specifying its
values arbitrarily on a basis. The same is true for free modules.

117

Theorem 4.5 Let 4 and 5 be 9-modules where 4 is free with basis
8 ~ ¸    0¹. Then we can define a unique 9 -map  ¢ 4 ¦ 5 by specifying
the values of   arbitrarily for all   8 and then extending  to 4 by
linearity, that is,
 ² # b Ä b  # ³ ~   # b Ä b   #

Homomorphisms
The term linear transformation is special to vector spaces. However, the
concept applies to most algebraic structures.
Definition Let 4 and 5 be 9 -modules. A function  ¢ 4 ¦ 5 is an 9 homomorphism or 9 -map if it preserves the module operations, that is,
 ²" b #³ ~  ²"³ b  ²#³
for all Á  9 and "Á #  4 . The set of all 9 -homomorphisms from 4 to 5 is
denoted by hom9 ²4 Á 5 ³. The following terms are also employed:
1) An 9 -endomorphism is an 9-homomorphism from 4 to itself.
2) An 9 -monomorphism or 9-embedding is an injective 9 -homomorphism.
3) An 9 -epimorphism is a surjective 9 -homomorphism.
4) An 9 -isomorphism is a bijective 9 -homomorphism.
It is easy to see that hom9 ²4 Á 5 ³ is itself an 9 -module under addition of
functions and scalar multiplication defined by
² ³²#³ ~ ² #³ ~  ²#³
Theorem 4.6 Let   hom9 ²4 Á 5 ³. The kernel and image of  , defined as for
linear transformations by
ker² ³ ~ ¸#  4   # ~ ¹
and
im² ³ ~ ¸ #  #  4 ¹
are submodules of 4 and 5 , respectively. Moreover,  is a monomorphism if
and only if ker² ³ ~ ¸¹.
If 5 is a submodule of the 9 -module 4 , then the map ¢ 5 ¦ 4 defined by
²#³ ~ # is evidently an 9 -monomorphism, called injection of 5 into 4 .

Quotient Modules
The procedure for defining quotient modules is the same as that for defining
quotient vector spaces. We summarize in the following theorem.

118

Advanced Linear Algebra

Theorem 4.7 Let : be a submodule of an 9 -module 4 . The binary relation
"#¯"c#:
is an equivalence relation on 4 , whose equivalence classes are the cosets
# b : ~ ¸# b 

 :¹

of : in 4 . The set 4 °: of all cosets of : in 4 , called the quotient module of
4 modulo : , is an 9 -module under the well-defined operations
²" b :³ b ²# b :³ ~ ²" b #³ b :
²" b :³ ~ " b :
The zero element in 4 °: is the coset  b : ~ : .
One question that immediately comes to mind is whether a quotient module of a
free module must be free. As the next example shows, the answer is no.
Example 4.6 As a module over itself, { is free on the set ¸¹. For any   ,
the set { ~ ¸'  '  {¹ is a free cyclic submodule of {, but the quotient {module {°{ is isomorphic to { via the map
 ²" b {³ ~ " mod 
and since { is not free as a {-module, neither is {°{.

The Correspondence and Isomorphism Theorems
The correspondence and isomorphism theorems for vector spaces have analogs
for modules.
Theorem 4.8 (The correspondence theorem) Let : be a submodule of 4 .
Then the function that assigns to each intermediate submodule :  ;  4 the
quotient submodule ; °: of 4 °: is an order-preserving (with respect to set
inclusion) one-to-one correspondence between submodules of 4 containing :
and all submodules of 4 °: .
Theorem 4.9 (The first isomorphism theorem) Let ¢ 4 ¦ 5 be an 9 homomorphism. Then the map  Z ¢ 4 °ker² ³ ¦ 5 defined by
 Z ²# b ker² ³³ ~  #
is an 9 -embedding and so

Direct Sums and Direct Summands
The definition of direct sum of a family of submodules is a direct analog of the
definition for vector spaces.
Definition The external direct sum of 9 -modules 4 Á Ã Á 4 , denoted by
4 ~ 4 ^ Ä ^ 4 
is the -module whose elements are ordered -tuples
4 ~ ¸²# Á Ã Á # ³  #  4 Á  ~ Á Ã Á ¹
with componentwise operations
²" Á Ã Á " ³ b ²# Á Ã Á # ³ ~ ²" b # Á Ã Á " b #³
and
²# Á Ã Á # ³ ~ ²# Á Ã Á # ³
for   9 .
We leave it to the reader to formulate the definition of external direct sums and
products for arbitrary families of modules, in direct analogy with the case of
vector spaces.
Definition An 9 -module 4 is the (internal) direct sum of a family
< ~ ¸:    0¹ of submodules of 4 , written
4 ~ <

or 4 ~ :
0

if the following hold:
1) (Join of the family) 4 is the sum (join) of the family < :
= ~ :
0

Advanced Linear Algebra

2) (Independence of the family) For each   0 ,
: q

p

:

q £

s
t

~ ¸¹

In this case, each : is called a direct summand of 4 . If < ~ ¸: Á Ã Á : ¹ is
a finite family, the direct sum is often written
4 ~ : l Ä l :
Finally, if 4 ~ : l ; , then : is said to be complemented and ; is called a
complement of : in 4 .
As with vector spaces, we have the following useful characterization of direct
sums.
Theorem 4.12 Let < ~ ¸:    0¹ be a family of distinct submodules of an 9 module 4 . The following are equivalent:
1) (Independence of the family) For each   0 ,
: q

p

:

q £

s
t

~ ¸¹

2) (Uniqueness of expression for ) The zero element  cannot be written as
a sum of nonzero elements from distinct submodules in < .
3) (Uniqueness of expression) Every nonzero #  4 has a unique, except for
order of terms, expression as a sum
#~

bÄb 

of nonzero elements from distinct submodules in < .
Hence, a sum
4 ~ :
0

is direct if and only if any one of 1)–3) holds.
In the case of vector spaces, every subspace is a direct summand, that is, every
subspace has a complement. However, as the next example shows, this is not
true for modules.
Example 4.7 The set { of integers is a {-module. Since the submodules of {
are precisely the ideals of the ring { and since { is a principal ideal domain, the
submodules of { are the sets
ºº»» ~ { ~ ¸'  '  {¹

Modules I: Basic Properties

121

Hence, any two nonzero proper submodules of { have nonzero intersection, for
if  £   , then
{ q { ~ {
where  ~ lcm¸Á ¹. It follows that the only complemented submodules of {
are { and ¸¹.
In the case of vector spaces, there is an intimate connection between subspaces
and quotient spaces, as we saw in Theorem 3.6. The problem we face in
generalizing this to modules is that not all submodules are complemented.
However, this is the only problem.
Theorem 4.13 Let : be a complemented submodule of 4 . All complements of
: are isomorphic to 4 °: and hence to each other.
Proof. For any complement ; of : , the first isomorphism theorem applied to
the projection ; Á: ¢ 4 ¦ ; gives ;  4 °: .

Direct Summands and Extensions of Isomorphisms
Direct summands play a role in questions relating to whether certain module
homomorphisms ¢ 5 ¦ 4 can be extended from a submodule 5  4 to the
full module 4 . The discussion will be a bit simpler if we restrict attention to
epimorphisms.
If 4 ~ 5 l / , then a module epimorphism ¢ 5 ¦ 4 can be extended to an
epimorphism ¢ 4 ¦ 4 simply by sending the elements of / to zero, that is,
by setting
² b ³ ~ 
This is easily seen to be an 9 -map with
ker²³ ~ ker²³ l /
Moreover, if  is another extension of  with the same kernel as  , then  and 
agree on / as well as on 5 , whence  ~  . Thus, there is a unique extension of
 with kernel ker²³ l / .
Now suppose that ¢ 5  4 is an isomorphism. If 5 is complemented, that is,
if
. ~5 l/
then we have seen that there is a unique extension  of  for which ker²³ ~ / .
Thus, the correspondence
/ ª ,

where ker²³ ~ /

from complements of 5 to extensions of  is an injection. To see that this
correspondence is a bijection, if ¢ 4 ¦ 4 is an extension of  , then

122

Advanced Linear Algebra

4 ~ 5 l ker²³
To see this, we have
5 q ker²³ ~ ker²³ ~ ¸¹
and if   4 , then there is a   5 for which  ~  and so
² c ³ ~  c  ~ 
Thus,
 ~  b ² c ³  5 b ker²³
which shows that ker²³ is a complement of 5 .
Theorem 4.14 Let 4 and 4 be 9 -modules and let 5  4 .
1) If 4 ~ 5 l / , then any 9 -epimorphism ¢ 5 ¦ 4 has a unique
extension ¢ 4 ¦ 4 to an epimorphism with
ker²³ ~ ker²³ l /
2) Let ¢ 5  4 be an 9 -isomorphism. Then the correspondence
/ ª ,

where ker²³ ~ /

is a bijection from complements of 5 onto the extensions of  . Thus, an
isomorphism ¢ 5  4 has an extension to 4 if and only if 5 is
complemented.
Definition Let 5  4 . When the identity map ¢ 5  5 has an extension to
¢ 4 ¦ 5 , the submodule 5 is called a retract of 4 and  is called the
retraction map.
Corollary 4.15 A submodule 5  4 is a retract of 4 if and only if 5 has a
complement in 4 .

Direct Summands and One-Sided Invertibility
Direct summands are also related to one-sided invertibility of 9 -maps.
Definition Let ¢ ( ¦ ) be a module homomorphism.
1) A left inverse of  is a module homomorphism 3 ¢ ) ¦ ( for which
3 k  ~  .
2) A right inverse of  is a module homomorphism 9 ¢ ) ¦ ( for which
 k 9 ~  .
Left and right inverses are called one-sided inverses. An ordinary inverse is
called a two-sided inverse.
Unlike a two-sided inverse, one-sided inverses need not be unique.

Modules I: Basic Properties

123

A left-invertible homomorphism  must be injective, since
  ~   ¬ 3 k   ~ 3 k   ¬  ~ 
Also, a right-invertible homomorphism ¢ ( ¦ ) must be surjective, since if
  ), then
 ~ ´9 ²³µ  im²³
For set functions, the converses of these statements hold:  is left-invertible if
and only if it is injective and  is right-invertible if and only if it is surjective.
However, this is not the case for 9 -maps.
Let ¢ 4 ¦ 4 be an injective 9 -map. Referring to Figure 4.1,

im(V) -1

Figure 4.1
the map Oim²³ ¢ 4  im²³ obtained from  by restricting its range to im²³ is
an isomorphism and the left inverses 3 of  are precisely the extensions of
²Oim²³ ³c ¢ im²³  4 to 4 . Hence, Theorem 4.14 says that the
correspondence
/ ª extension of ²Oim²³ ³c with kernel /
is a bijection from the complements / of im²³ onto the left inverses of  .
Now let ¢ 4 ¦ 4 be a surjective 9 -map. Referring to Figure 4.2,

ker(V)

if ker²³ is complemented, that is, if
4 ~ ker²³ l /

then O/ ¢ /  4 is an isomorphism. Thus, a map  ¢ 4 ¦ 4 is a right
inverse of  if and only if  is a range-extension of ²O/ ³c ¢ 4  / , the only
difference being in the ranges of the two functions. Hence, ²O/ ³c ¢ 4 ¦ 4
is the only right inverse of  with image / . It follows that the correspondence
/ ª ²O/ ³c ¢ 4 ¦ 4
is an injection from the complements / of ker²³ to the right inverses of .
Moreover, this map is a bijection, since if 9 ¢ 4 ¦ 4 is a right inverse of  ,
c
¢ im²9 ³  4 , which
then 9 ¢ 4  im²9 ³ and  is an extension of 9
implies that
4 ~ im²9 ³ l ker²³
Theorem 4.16 Let 4 and 4 be 9 -modules and let ¢ 4 ¦ 4 be an 9 -map.
1) Let ¢ 4 Æ 4 be injective. The map
/ ª extension of ²Oim²³ ³c with kernel /
is a bijection from the complements / of im²³ onto the left inverses of  .
Thus, there is exactly one left inverse of  for each complement of im²³
and that complement is the kernel of the left inverse.
2) Let ¢ 4 ¦ 4 be surjective. The map
/ ª ²O/ ³c ¢ 4 ¦ 4
is a bijection from the complements / of ker²³ to the right inverses of .
Thus, there is exactly one right inverse of  for each complement / of
ker²³ and that complement is the image of the right inverse. Thus,
4 ~ ker²³ l /  ker²³ ^ im²³
The last part of the previous theorem is worth further comment. Recall that if
¢ = ¦ > is a linear transformation on vector spaces, then
=  ker² ³ ^ im² ³
This holds for modules as well provided that ker² ³ is a direct summand.

Modules Are Not as Nice as Vector Spaces
Here is a list of some of the properties of modules (over commutative rings with
identity) that emphasize the differences between modules and vector spaces.
1) A submodule of a module need not have a complement.
2) A submodule of a finitely generated module need not be finitely generated.
3) There exist modules with no linearly independent elements and hence with
no basis.
4) A minimal spanning set or maximal linearly independent set is not
necessarily a basis.

Modules I: Basic Properties

125

5) There exist free modules with submodules that are not free.
6) There exist free modules with linearly independent sets that are not
contained in a basis and spanning sets that do not contain a basis.
Recall also that a module over a noncommutative ring may have bases of
different sizes. However, all bases for a free module over a commutative ring
with identity have the same size, as we will prove in the next chapter.

Modules II: Free and Noetherian Modules

The Rank of a Free Module
Since all bases for a vector space = have the same cardinality, the concept of
vector space dimension is well-defined. A similar statement holds for free 9 modules when the base ring is commutative (but not otherwise).
Theorem 5.1 Let 4 be a free module over a commutative ring 9 with identity.
1) Then any two bases of 4 have the same cardinality.
2) The cardinality of a spanning set is greater than or equal to that of a basis.
Proof. The plan is to find a vector space = with the property that, for any basis
for 4 , there is a basis of the same cardinality for = . Then we can appeal to the
corresponding result for vector spaces.
Let ? be a maximal ideal of 9 , which exists by Theorem 0.23. Then 9°? is a
field. Our first thought might be that 4 is a vector space over 9°? , but that is
not the case. In fact, scalar multiplication using the field 9°? ,
² b ? ³# ~ #
is not even well-defined, since this would require that ? 4 ~ ¸¹. On the other
hand, we can fix precisely this problem by factoring out the submodule
? 4 ~ ¸ # b Ä b  #    ? Á #  4 ¹
Indeed, 4 °? 4 is a vector space over 9°? , with scalar multiplication defined
by
² b ? ³²" b ? 4 ³ ~ " b ? 4
To see that this is well-defined, we must show that the conditions
 b ? ~ Z b ?
" b ? 4 ~ "Z b ? 4
imply

" b ? 4 ~ Z "Z b ? 4
But this follows from the fact that
" c Z "Z ~ ²" c "Z ³ b ² c Z ³"Z  ? 4
Hence, scalar multiplication is well-defined. We leave it to the reader to show
that 4 °? 4 is a vector space over 9°? .
Consider now a set 8 ~ ¸    0¹  4 and the corresponding set
8 b ? 4 ~ ¸ b ? 4    0¹ 

4
?4

If 8 spans 4 over 9, then 8 b ? 4 spans 4 °? 4 over 9°? . To see this, note
that any #  4 has the form # ~ '  for   9 and so
# b ? 4 ~ 8   9 b ? 4


~   ² b ? 4 ³


~  ² b ? ³² b ? 4 ³


which shows that 8 b ? 4 spans 4 °? 4 .
Now suppose that 8 ~ ¸    0¹ is a basis for 4 over 9 . We show that
8 b ? 4 is a basis for 4 °? 4 over 9°? . We have seen that 8 b ? 4 spans
4 °? 4 . Also, if
 ² b ? ³² b ? 4 ³ ~ ? 4


then     ? 4 and so
   ~   




where   ? . From the linear independence of 8 we deduce that   ? for all
 and so  b ? ~ ? . Hence 8 b ? 4 is linearly independent and therefore a
basis, as desired.
To see that (8 ( ~ (8 b ? 4 (, note that if  b ? 4 ~  b ? 4 , then
 c  ~   


where   ? . If  £  , then the coefficient of  on the right must be equal to

 and so   ? , which is not possible since ? is a maximal ideal. Hence,
 ~   .
Thus, if 8 is a basis for 4 over 9 , then
(8 ( ~ (8 b ? 4 ( ~ dim9°? ²4 °? 4 ³
and so all bases for 4 over 9 have the same cardinality, which proves part 1).
Finally, if 8 spans 4 over 9 , then 8 b ? 4 spans 4 °? 4 and so
dim9°? ²4 °? 4 ³  (8 b ? 4 (  (8 (
Thus, 8 has cardinality at least as great as that of any basis for 4 over 9 .
The previous theorem allows us to define the rank of a free module. (The term
dimension is not used for modules in general.)
Definition Let 9 be a commutative ring with identity. The rank rk²4 ³ of a
nonzero free 9 -module 4 is the cardinality of any basis for 4 . The rank of the
trivial module ¸¹ is .
Theorem 5.1 fails if the underlying ring of scalars is not commutative. The next
example describes a module over a noncommutative ring that has the
remarkable property of possessing a basis of size  for any positive integer .
Example 5.1 Let = be a vector space over - with a countably infinite basis
8 ~ ¸ Á  Á Ã ¹. Let B²= ³ be the ring of linear operators on = . Observe that
B²= ³ is not commutative, since composition of functions is not commutative.
The ring B²= ³ is an B²= ³-module and as such, the identity map  forms a basis
for B²= ³. However, we can also construct a basis for B²= ³ of any desired finite
size . To understand the idea, consider the case  ~  and define the operators
 and  by
 ² ³ ~  Á  ²b ³ ~ 
and
 ² ³ ~ Á  ²b ³ ~ 
These operators are linearly independent essentially because they are surjective
and their supports are disjoint. In particular, if
  b   ~ 
then
 ~ ²  b  ³² ³ ~  ² ³

and
 ~ ²  b  ³²b ³ ~ ² ³
which shows that  ~  and  ~ . Moreover, if   B²= ³, then we define 
and  by
 ² ³ ~ ² ³
² ³ ~ ²b ³
from which it follows easily that
 ~   b  
which shows that ¸ Á  ¹ is a basis for B²= ³.
More generally, we begin by partitioning 8 into  blocks. For each
~ Á Ã Á  c , let
8 ~ ¸    mod ¹
Now we define elements   B²= ³ by
 ²b! ³ ~ !Á 
where   !   and where !Á is the Kronecker delta function. These functions
are surjective and have disjoint support. It follows that 9 ~ ¸0 Á Ã Á c ¹ is
linearly independent. For if
 ~   b Ä b c c
where   B²= ³, then, applying this to b! gives
 ~ ! ! ²b! ³ ~ ! ² ³
for all  . Hence, ! ~ .
Also, 9 spans B²= ³, for if   B²= ³, we define   B²= ³ by
 ² ³ ~  ²+ ³
to get
²  b Ä b c c ³²+! ³ ~ ! ! ²+! ³ ~ ! ² ³ ~  ²+! ³
and so
 ~   b Ä b c c
Thus, 9 ~ ¸0 Á Ã Á c ¹ is a basis for B²= ³ of size .
Recall that if ) is a basis for a vector space = over - , then = is isomorphic to
the vector space ²- ) ³ of all functions from ) to - that have finite support. A
