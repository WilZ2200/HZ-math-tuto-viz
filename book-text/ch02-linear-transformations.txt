specifying the values of  # arbitrarily for all #  8 and extending  to = by
linearity, that is,
 ² # b Ä b  # ³ ~   # b Ä b   #
This process defines a unique linear transformation, that is, if  Á   B²= Á > ³
satisfy  # ~ # for all #  8 then  ~  .
Proof. The crucial point is that the extension by linearity is well-defined, since
each vector in = has an essentially unique representation as a linear
combination of a finite number of vectors in 8 . We leave the details to the
reader.
Note that if   B²= Á > ³ and if : is a subspace of = , then the restriction  O: of
 to : is a linear transformation from : to > .

The Kernel and Image of a Linear Transformation
There are two very important vector spaces associated with a linear
transformation  from = to > .
Definition Let   B²= Á > ³. The subspace
ker² ³ ~ ¸#  =   # ~ ¹
is called the kernel of  and the subspace
im² ³ ~ ¸ #  #  = ¹
is called the image of  . The dimension of ker² ³ is called the nullity of  and is
denoted by null² ³. The dimension of im² ³ is called the rank of  and is
denoted by rk² ³.
It is routine to show that ker² ³ is a subspace of = and im² ³ is a subspace of
> . Moreover, we have the following.
Theorem 2.3 Let   B²= Á > ³. Then
1)  is surjective if and only if im² ³ ~ >
2)  is injective if and only if ker² ³ ~ ¸¹
Proof. The first statement is merely a restatement of the definition of
surjectivity. To see the validity of the second statement, observe that
 " ~  # ¯  ²" c #³ ~  ¯ " c #  ker² ³
Hence, if ker² ³ ~ ¸¹, then  " ~  # ¯ " ~ #, which shows that  is injective.
Conversely, if  is injective and "  ker² ³, then  " ~   and so " ~ . This
shows that ker² ³ ~ ¸¹.

Isomorphisms
Definition A bijective linear transformation ¢ = ¦ > is called an
isomorphism from = to > . When an isomorphism from = to > exists, we say
that = and > are isomorphic and write =  > .
Example 2.2 Let dim²= ³ ~ . For any ordered basis 8 of = , the coordinate
map 8 ¢ = ¦ -  that sends each vector #  = to its coordinate matrix
´#µ8  -  is an isomorphism. Hence, any -dimensional vector space over - is
isomorphic to -  .
Isomorphic vector spaces share many properties, as the next theorem shows. If
  B²= Á > ³ and :  = we write
 : ~ ¸ 

 :¹

Theorem 2.4 Let   B²= Á > ³ be an isomorphism. Let :  = . Then
1) : spans = if and only if  : spans > .
2) : is linearly independent in = if and only if  : is linearly independent in
>.
3) : is a basis for = if and only if  : is a basis for > .
An isomorphism can be characterized as a linear transformation ¢ = ¦ > that
maps a basis for = to a basis for > .
Theorem 2.5 A linear transformation   B²= Á > ³ is an isomorphism if and
only if there is a basis 8 for = for which 8 is a basis for > . In this case, 
maps any basis of = to a basis of > .
The following theorem says that, up to isomorphism, there is only one vector
space of any given dimension over a given field.
Theorem 2.6 Let = and > be vector spaces over - . Then =  > if and only
if dim²= ³ ~ dim²> ³.
In Example 2.2, we saw that any -dimensional vector space is isomorphic to
-  . Now suppose that ) is a set of cardinality  and let ²- ) ³ be the vector
space of all functions from ) to - with finite support. We leave it to the reader
to show that the functions   ²- ) ³ defined for all   ) by
 ²%³ ~ F

form a basis for ²- ) ³ , called the standard basis. Hence, dim²²- ) ³ ³ ~ () (.
It follows that for any cardinal number , there is a vector space of dimension  .
Also, any vector space of dimension  is isomorphic to ²- ) ³ .

Theorem 2.7 If  is a natural number, then any -dimensional vector space
over - is isomorphic to -  . If  is any cardinal number and if ) is a set of
cardinality  , then any -dimensional vector space over - is isomorphic to the
vector space ²- ) ³ of all functions from ) to - with finite support.

The Rank Plus Nullity Theorem
Let   B²= Á > ³. Since any subspace of = has a complement, we can write
= ~ ker² ³ l ker² ³
where ker² ³ is a complement of ker² ³ in = . It follows that
dim²= ³ ~ dim²ker² ³³ b dim²ker² ³ ³
Now, the restriction of  to ker² ³ ,
  ¢ ker² ³ ¦ >
is injective, since
ker²  ³ ~ ker² ³ q ker² ³ ~ ¸¹
Also, im²  ³  im² ³. For the reverse inclusion, if  #  im² ³, then since
# ~ " b $ for "  ker² ³ and $  ker² ³ , we have
 # ~  " b  $ ~  $ ~   $  im²  ³
Thus im²  ³ ~ im² ³. It follows that
ker² ³  im² ³
From this, we deduce the following theorem.
Theorem 2.8 Let   B²= Á > ³.
1) Any complement of ker² ³ is isomorphic to im² ³
2) (The rank plus nullity theorem)
dim²ker² ³³ b dim²im² ³³ ~ dim²= ³
or, in other notation,
rk² ³ b null² ³ ~ dim²= ³
Theorem 2.8 has an important corollary.
Corollary 2.9 Let   B²= Á > ³, where dim²= ³ ~ dim²> ³  B. Then  is
injective if and only if it is surjective.
Note that this result fails if the vector spaces are not finite-dimensional. The
reader is encouraged to find an example to support this statement.

Linear Transformations from -  to - 
Recall that for any  d  matrix ( over - the multiplication map
( ²#³ ~ (#
is a linear transformation. In fact, any linear transformation   B²-  Á -  ³ has
this form, that is,  is just multiplication by a matrix, for we have
2   Ä    3 ~ 2   Ä    3²³ ~  
and so  ~ ( , where
( ~ 2   Ä    3
Theorem 2.10
1) If ( is an  d  matrix over - then (  B²-  Á -  ³.
2) If   B²-  Á -  ³ then  ~ ( , where

The matrix ( is called the matrix of  .
Example 2.3 Consider the linear transformation ¢ -  ¦ -  defined by

Theorem 2.11 Let ( be an  d  matrix over - .
1) ( ¢ -  ¦ -  is injective if and only if rk²(³ ~ n.
2) ( ¢ -  ¦ -  is surjective if and only if rk²(³ ~ m.

Change of Basis Matrices
Suppose that 8 ~ ² Á Ã Á  ³ and 9 ~ ² Á Ã Á  ³ are ordered bases for a
vector space = . It is natural to ask how the coordinate matrices ´#µ8 and ´#µ9 are
related. Referring to Figure 2.1,

Fn

IC(IB)-1

Figure 2.1
the map that takes ´#µ8 to ´#µ9 is 8Á9 ~ 9 8c and is called the change of basis
operator (or change of coordinates operator). Since 8Á9 is an operator on
-  , it has the form ( , where
( ~ ²8Á9 ² ³  Ä  8Á9 ² ³³
~ ²9 8c ²´ µ8 ³  Ä  9 8c ²´ µ8 ³³
~ ²´ µ9  Ä  ´ µ9 ³³
We denote ( by 48,9 and call it the change of basis matrix from 8 to 9.
Theorem 2.12 Let 8 ~ ² Á Ã Á  ³ and 9 be ordered bases for a vector space
= . Then the change of basis operator 8Á9 ~ 9 8c is an automorphism of -  ,
whose standard matrix is
48,9 ~ ²´ µ9  Ä  ´ µ9 ³³
Hence
´#µ9 ~ 48Á9 ´#µ8
and 49Á8 ~ 48c
,9 .
Consider the equation
( ~ 48 Á 9
or equivalently,
( ~ ²´ µ9  Ä  ´ µ9 ³³
Then given any two of ( (an invertible  d  matrix)Á 8 (an ordered basis for
-  ) and 9 (an ordered basis for -  ), the third component is uniquely
determined by this equation. This is clear if 8 and 9 are given or if ( and 9 are

66

given. If ( and 8 are given, then there is a unique 9 for which (c ~ 49Á8 and
so there is a unique 9 for which ( ~ 48Á9 .
Theorem 2.13 If we are given any two of the following:
1) an invertible  d  matrix (
2) an ordered basis 8 for - 
3) an ordered basis 9 for -  .
then the third is uniquely determined by the equation
( ~ 48 Á 9

The Matrix of a Linear Transformation
Let ¢ = ¦ > be a linear transformation, where dim²= ³ ~  and
dim²> ³ ~  and let 8 ~ ² Á Ã Á  ³ be an ordered basis for = and 9 an
ordered basis for > . Then the map
¢ ´#µ8 ¦ ´ #µ9
is a representation of  as a linear transformation from -  to -  , in the sense
that knowing (along with 8 and 9, of course) is equivalent to knowing  . Of
course, this representation depends on the choice of ordered bases 8 and 9.
Since is a linear transformation from -  to -  , it is just multiplication by an
 d  matrix (, that is,
´ #µ9 ~ (´#µ8
Indeed, since ´ µ8 ~  , we get the columns of ( as follows:
(²³ ~ ( ~ (´# µ8 ~ ´  µ9
Theorem 2.14 Let   B²= Á > ³ and let 8 ~ ² Á Ã Á  ³ and 9 be ordered
bases for = and > , respectively. Then  can be represented with respect to 8
and 9 as matrix multiplication, that is,
´ #µ9 ~ ´ µ8,9 ´#µ8
where
´ µ8,9 ~ ²´  µ9  Ä  ´  µ9 ³
is called the matrix of  with respect to the bases 8 and 9 . When = ~ > and
8 ~ 9, we denote ´ µ8,8 by ´ µ8 and so
´ #µ8 ~ ´ µ8 ´#µ8
Example 2.4 Let +¢ F ¦ F be the derivative operator, defined on the vector
space of all polynomials of degree at most . Let 8 ~ 9 ~ ²Á %Á % ³. Then

The following result shows that we may work equally well with linear
transformations or with the matrices that represent them (with respect to fixed
ordered bases 8 and 9). This applies not only to addition and scalar
multiplication, but also to matrix multiplication.
Theorem 2.15 Let = and > be finite-dimensional vector spaces over - , with
ordered bases 8 ~ ² Á Ã Á  ³ and 9 ~ ² Á Ã Á  ³, respectively.
1) The map ¢ B²= Á > ³ ¦ CÁ ²- ³ defined by
² ³ ~ ´ µ8,9
is an isomorphism and so B²= Á > ³  CÁ ²- ³. Hence,
dim²B²= Á > ³³ ~ dim²CÁ ²- ³³ ~  d 
2) If   B²< Á = ³ and   B²= Á > ³ and if 8 , 9 and : are ordered bases for
< , = and > , respectively, then
´µ8,: ~ ´ µ9,: ´µ8,9
Thus, the matrix of the product (composition)  is the product of the
matrices of  and  . In fact, this is the primary motivation for the definition
of matrix multiplication.
Proof. To see that  is linear, observe that for all ,
´  b ! µ8Á9 ´ µ8 ~ ´²  b ! ³² ³µ9
~ ´ ² ³ b ! ² ³µ9

~ ´µ8Á9 ´ µ8 b !´ µ8Á9 ´ µ8
~ ² ´µ8Á9 b !´ µ8Á9 ³´ µ8

68

Advanced Linear Algebra

and since ´ µ8 ~  is a standard basis vector, we conclude that
´  b ! µ8Á9 ~ ´µ8Á9 b !´ µ8Á9
and so  is linear. If (  CÁ , we define  by the condition ´  µ9 ~ (²³ ,
whence ² ³ ~ ( and  is surjective. Also, ker²³ ~ ¸¹ since ´ µ8 ~ 

have
´µ8Á: ´#µ8 ~ ´ ²#³µ: ~ ´ µ9,: ´#µ9 ~ ´ µ9Á: ´µ8Á9 ´#µ8

Change of Bases for Linear Transformations
Since the matrix ´ µ8,9 that represents  depends on the ordered bases 8 and 9 , it
is natural to wonder how to choose these bases in order to make this matrix as
simple as possible. For instance, can we always choose the bases so that  is
represented by a diagonal matrix?
As we will see in Chapter 7, the answer to this question is no. In that chapter,
we will take up the general question of how best to represent a linear operator
by a matrix. For now, let us take the first step and describe the relationship
between the matrices ´ µ8Á9 and ´ µ8Z Á9Z of  with respect to two different pairs
²8 Á 9³ and ²8 Z Á 9Z ³ of ordered bases. Multiplication by ´ µ8Z Á9Z sends ´#µ8Z to
´ #µ9Z . This can be reproduced by first switching from 8 Z to 8 , then applying
´ µ8Á9 and finally switching from 9 to 9Z , that is,
´ µ8Z ,9Z ~ 49Á9Z ´ µ8,9 48Z Á8 ~ 49Á9Z ´ µ8,9 48c
Á8 Z
Theorem 2.16 Let   B²= ,> ³ and let ²8 Á 9³ and ²8 Z Á 9Z ³ be pairs of ordered
bases of = and > , respectively. Then
´ µ8Z Á9Z ~ 49Á9Z ´ µ8Á9 48Z Á8

(2.1)

When   B²= ³ is a linear operator on = , it is generally more convenient to
represent  by matrices of the form ´ µ8 , where the ordered bases used to
represent vectors in the domain and image are the same. When 8 ~ 9, Theorem
2.16 takes the following important form.
Corollary 2.17 Let   B²= ³ and let 8 and 9 be ordered bases for = . Then the
matrix of  with respect to 9 can be expressed in terms of the matrix of  with
respect to 8 as follows:
´ µ9 ~ 48Á9 ´ µ8 48c
Á9

(2.2)

Equivalence of Matrices
Since the change of basis matrices are precisely the invertible matrices, (2.1) has
the form

Linear Transformations

69

´ µ8Z Á9Z ~ 7 ´ µ8Á9 8c
where 7 and 8 are invertible matrices. This motivates the following definition.
Definition Two matrices ( and ) are equivalent if there exist invertible
matrices 7 and 8 for which
) ~ 7 (8c
We have remarked that ) is equivalent to ( if and only if ) can be obtained
from ( by a series of elementary row and column operations. Performing the
row operations is equivalent to multiplying the matrix ( on the left by 7 and
performing the column operations is equivalent to multiplying ( on the right by
8c .
In terms of (2.1), we see that performing row operations (premultiplying by 7 )
is equivalent to changing the basis used to represent vectors in the image and
performing column operations (postmultiplying by 8c ) is equivalent to
changing the basis used to represent vectors in the domain.
According to Theorem 2.16, if ( and ) are matrices that represent  with
respect to possibly different ordered bases, then ( and ) are equivalent. The
converse of this also holds.
Theorem 2.18 Let = and > be vector spaces with dim²= ³ ~  and
dim²> ³ ~ . Then two  d  matrices ( and ) are equivalent if and only if
they represent the same linear transformation   B²= Á > ³, but possibly with
respect to different ordered bases. In this case, ( and ) represent exactly the
same set of linear transformations in B²= Á > ³.
Proof. If ( and ) represent  , that is, if
( ~ ´ µ8,9

and

) ~ ´ µ8Z ,9Z

for ordered bases 8 Á 9Á 8 Z and 9Z , then Theorem 2.16 shows that ( and ) are
equivalent. Now suppose that ( and ) are equivalent, say
) ~ 7 (8c
where 7 and 8 are invertible. Suppose also that ( represents a linear
transformation   B²= Á > ³ for some ordered bases 8 and 9, that is,
( ~ ´ µ8Á9
Theorem 2.9 implies that there is a unique ordered basis 8 Z for = for which
8 ~ 48Á8Z and a unique ordered basis 9Z for > for which 7 ~ 49Á9Z . Hence
) ~ 49Á9Z ´ µ8Á9 48Z Á8 ~ ´ µ8Z Á9Z

70

Advanced Linear Algebra

Hence, ) also represents  . By symmetry, we see that ( and ) represent the
same set of linear transformations. This completes the proof.
We remarked in Example 0.3 that every matrix is equivalent to exactly one
matrix of the block form
1 ~ >

0
cÁ

Ác
cÁc ?block

Hence, the set of these matrices is a set of canonical forms for equivalence.
Moreover, the rank is a complete invariant for equivalence. In other words, two
matrices are equivalent if and only if they have the same rank.

Similarity of Matrices
When a linear operator   B²= ³ is represented by a matrix of the form ´ µ8 ,
equation (2.2) has the form
´ µ8Z ~ 7 ´ µ8 7 c
where 7 is an invertible matrix. This motivates the following definition.
Definition Two matrices ( and ) are similar, denoted by (  ) , if there
exists an invertible matrix 7 for which
) ~ 7 (7 c
The equivalence classes associated with similarity are called similarity
classes.
The analog of Theorem 2.18 for square matrices is the following.
Theorem 2.19 Let = be a vector space of dimension . Then two  d 
matrices ( and ) are similar if and only if they represent the same linear
operator   B²= ³, but possibly with respect to different ordered bases. In this
case, ( and ) represent exactly the same set of linear operators in B²= ³.
Proof. If ( and ) represent   B²= ³, that is, if
( ~ ´ µ8

and ) ~ ´ µ9

for ordered bases 8 and 9, then Corollary 2.17 shows that ( and ) are similar.
Now suppose that ( and ) are similar, say
) ~ 7 (7 c
Suppose also that ( represents a linear operator   B²= ³ for some ordered
basis 8 , that is,
( ~ ´ µ8
Theorem 2.9 implies that there is a unique ordered basis 9 for = for which

71

7 ~ 48Á9 . Hence
) ~ 48Á9 ´ µ8 48c
Á 9 ~ ´ µ9
Hence, ) also represents  . By symmetry, we see that ( and ) represent the
same set of linear operators. This completes the proof.
We will devote much effort in Chapter 7 to finding a canonical form for
similarity.

Similarity of Operators
We can also define similarity of operators.
Definition Two linear operators  Á   B²= ³ are similar, denoted by   , if
there exists an automorphism   B²= ³ for which
 ~ c
The equivalence classes associated with similarity are called similarity
classes.
Note that if 8 ~ ² Á Ã Á  ³ and 9 ~ ² Á Ã Á  ³ are ordered bases for = , then
49Á8 ~ ²´ µ8  Ä  ´ µ8 ³
Now, the map defined by ² ³ ~  is an automorphism of = and
49Á8 ~ ²´² ³µ8  Ä  ´² ³µ8 ³ ~ ´µ8
Conversely, if ¢ = ¦ = is an automorphism and 8 ~ ² Á Ã Á  ³ is an ordered
basis for = , then 9 ~ ² ~ ² ³Á Ã Á  ~ ² ³³ is also a basis:
´µ8 ~ ²´² ³µ8  Ä  ´² ³µ8 ³ ~ 49Á8
The analog of Theorem 2.19 for linear operators is the following.
Theorem 2.20 Let = be a vector space of dimension . Then two linear
operators  and  on = are similar if and only if there is a matrix (  C that
represents both operators, but with respect to possibly different ordered bases.
In this case,  and  are represented by exactly the same set of matrices in C .
Proof. If  and  are represented by (  C , that is, if
´ µ8 ~ ( ~ ´µ9
for ordered bases 8 and 9, then
´µ9 ~ ´ µ8 ~ 49Á8 ´ µ9 48Á9
As remarked above, if ¢ = ¦ = is defined by ² ³ ~  , then

´µ9 ~ 48Á9
and so
c
´µ9 ~ ´µc
9 ´ µ9 ´µ9 ~ ´ µ9

from which it follows that  and  are similar. Conversely, suppose that  and 
are similar, say
 ~ c
where  is an automorphism of = . Suppose also that  is represented by the
matrix (  C , that is,
( ~ ´ µ8
for some ordered basis 8 . Then ´µ8 ~ 49Á8 and so
c
´µ8 ~ ´c µ8 ~ ´µ8 ´ µ8 ´µc
8 ~ 4 9 Á8 ´  µ 8 4 9 Á 8

It follows that
( ~ ´ µ8 ~ 48Á9 ´µ8 48c
Á9 ~ ´ µ9
and so ( also represents . By symmetry, we see that  and  are represented
by the same set of matrices. This completes the proof.
We can summarize the sitiation with respect to similarity in Figure 2.2. Each
similarity class I in B²= ³ corresponds to a similarity class J in C ²- ³: J is
the set of all matrices that represent any   I and I is the set of all operators

Invariant Subspaces and Reducing Pairs
The restriction of a linear operator   B²= ³ to a subspace : of = is not
necessarily a linear operator on : . This prompts the following definition.

Linear Transformations

73

Definition Let   B²= ³. A subspace : of = is said to be invariant under  or
 -invariant if  :  : , that is, if   : for all  : . Put another way, : is
invariant under  if the restriction O: is a linear operator on : .
If
= ~: l;
then the fact that : is  -invariant does not imply that the complement ; is also
 -invariant. (The reader may wish to supply a simple example with = ~ s .)
Definition Let   B²= ³. If = ~ : l ; and if both : and ; are  -invariant,
we say that the pair ²:Á ; ³ reduces  .
A reducing pair can be used to decompose a linear operator into a direct sum as
follows.
Definition Let   B²= ³. If ²:Á ; ³ reduces  we write
 ~  O: l  O ;
and call  the direct sum of  O: and  O; . Thus, the expression
 ~l
means that there exist subspaces : and ; of = for which ²:Á ; ³ reduces  and
 ~ O: and  ~ O;
The concept of the direct sum of linear operators will play a key role in the
study of the structure of a linear operator.

Projection Operators
We will have several uses for a special type of linear operator that is related to
direct sums.
Definition Let = ~ : l ; . The linear operator :Á; ¢ = ¦ = defined by
:Á; ² b !³ ~
where  : and !  ; is called projection onto : along ; .
Whenever we say that the operator :Á; is a projection, it is with the
understanding that = ~ : l ; . The following theorem describes a few basic
properties of projection operators. We leave proof as an exercise.
Theorem 2.21 Let = be a vector space and let   B²= ³.

3) If   B²= ³ has the property that

and

Oim²³ ~ 

then  is projection onto im²³ along ker²³.
Projection operators are easy to characterize.
Definition A linear operator   B²= ³ is idempotent if   ~  .
Theorem 2.22 A linear operator   B²= ³ is a projection if and only if it is
idempotent.
Proof. If  ~ :Á; , then for any  : and !  ; ,
 ² b !³ ~  ~

~ ² b !³

and so  ~ . Conversely, suppose that  is idempotent. If #  im²³ q ker²³,
then # ~ % and so
 ~ # ~  % ~ % ~ #
Hence im²³ q ker²³ ~ ¸¹. Also, if #  = , then
# ~ ²# c #³ b #  ker²³ l im²³
and so = ~ ker²³ l im²³. Finally, ²%³ ~  % ~ % and so Oim²³ ~  .
Hence,  is projection onto im²³ along ker²³.

Projections and Invariance
Projections can be used to characterize invariant subspaces. Let   B²= ³ and
let : be a subspace of = . Let  ~ :Á; for any complement ; of : . The key is
that the elements of : can be characterized as those vectors fixed by , that is,

 : if and only if  ~ . Hence, the following are equivalent:
:  :
  : for all  :
² ³ ~  for all  :
² ³ ~  for all  :
Thus, : is  -invariant if and only if  ~  for all vectors  : . But this is
also true for all vectors in ; , since both sides are equal to  on ; . This proves
the following theorem.
Theorem 2.23 Let   B²= ³. Then a subspace : of = is  -invariant if and only
if there is a projection  ~ :Á; for which
 ~ 
in which case this holds for all projections of the form  ~ :Á; .
We also have the following relationship between projections and reducing pairs.
Theorem 2.24 Let = ~ : l ; . Then ²:Á ; ³ reduces   B²= ³ if and only if 
commutes with :Á; .
Proof. Theorem 2.23 implies that : and ; are  -invariant if and only if
and

:Á; :Á; ~ :Á; 

² c :Á; ³ ² c :Á; ³ ~ ² c :Á; ³

and a little algebra shows that this is equivalent to
:Á; :Á; ~ :Á; 

and

:Á;  ~ :Á;

which is equivalent to :Á;  ~ :Á; .

Orthogonal Projections and Resolutions of the Identity
Observe that if  is a projection, then
² c ³ ~ ² c ³ ~ 
Definition Two projections Á   B²= ³ are orthogonal, written    , if
 ~  ~ 
Note that    if and only if
im²³  ker²³

and

im²³  ker²³

The following example shows that it is not enough to have  ~  in the
definition of orthogonality. In fact, it is possible for  ~  and yet  is not
even a projection.

Example 2.5 Let = ~ -  and consider the ? - and @ -axes and the diagonal:
? ~ ¸²%Á ³  %  - ¹
@ ~ ¸²Á &³  &  - ¹
+ ~ ¸²%Á %³  %  - ¹
Then
+Á? +Á@ ~ +Á@ £ +Á? ~ +Á@ +Á?
From this we deduce that if  and  are projections, it may happen that both
products  and  are projections, but that they are not equal. We leave it to
the reader to show that @ Á? ?Á+ ~  (which is a projection), but that ?Á+ @ Á?
is not a projection.
Since a projection  is idempotent, we can write the identity operator  as s sum
of two orthogonal projections:
 b ² c  ³ ~  Á

  ² c  ³

Let us generalize this to more than two projections.
Definition A resolution of the identity on = is a sum of the form
 b Ä b   ~ 
where the  's are pairwise orthogonal projections, that is,    for  £ .
There is a connection between the resolutions of the identity on = and direct
sum decompositions of = . In general terms, if
 b Ä b  ~ 
for any linear operators   B²= ³, then for all #  = ,
# ~  # b Ä b  #  im² ³ b Ä b im² ³
and so
= ~ im² ³ b Ä b im² ³
However, the sum need not be direct.
Theorem 2.25 Let = be a vector space. Resolutions of the identity on =
correspond to direct sum decompositions of = as follows:
1) If  b Ä b  ~  is a resolution of the identity, then
= ~ im² ³ l Ä l im² ³

Linear Transformations

77

and  is projection onto im² ³ along
ker² ³ ~  im² ³
£

2) Conversely, if
= ~ : l Ä l :
and if  is projection onto : along the direct sum £ : ,, then
 b Ä b  ~  is a resolution of the identity.
Proof. To prove 1), if  b Ä b  ~  is a resolution of the identity, then
= ~ im² ³ b Ä b im² ³
Moreover, if
 % b Ä b  % ~ 
then applying  gives  % ~  and so the sum is direct. As to the kernel of  ,
we have
im² ³ l ker² ³ ~ = ~ im² ³ l

p

 im² ³

q £

s
t

and since   ~ , it follows that
 im² ³  ker² ³
£

and so equality must hold. For part 2), suppose that
= ~ : l Ä l :
and  is projection onto : along £ : . If  £ , then
im² ³ ~ :  ker² ³
and so    . Also, if # ~
#~

 b Ä b  for

  : , then

 b Ä b  ~  # b Ä b  # ~ ² b Ä b  ³#

and so  ~  b Ä b  is a resolution of the identity.

The Algebra of Projections
If  and  are projections, it does not necessarily follow that  b  ,  c  or 
is a projection. For example, the sum  b  is a projection if and only if
² b ³ ~  b 

78

Advanced Linear Algebra

which is equivalent to
 ~ c
Of course, this holds if  ~  ~ , that is, if   . But the converse is also
true, provided that char²- ³ £ . To see this, we simply evaluate  in two
ways:
²³ ~ c²³ ~ c
and
²³ ~ c²³ ~ c
Hence,  ~  ~ c and so  ~ . It follows that  ~ c ~  and so
  . Thus, for char²- ³ £ , we have  b  is a projection if and only if
  .
Now suppose that  b  is a projection. For the kernel of  b , note that
² b ³# ~ 

¬

² b ³# ~ 

¬

# ~ 

and similarly, # ~ . Hence, ker² b ³  ker²³ q ker²³. But the reverse
inclusion is obvious and so
ker² b ³ ~ ker²³ q ker²³
As to the image of  b  , we have
#  im² b ³

¬

# ~ ² b ³# ~ # b #  im²³ b im²³

and so im² b ³  im²³ b im²³. For the reverse inclusion, if # ~ % b &,
then
² b ³# ~ ² b ³²% b &³ ~ % b & ~ #
and so #  im² b ³. Thus, im² b ³ ~ im²³ b im²³. Finally,  ~ 
implies that im²³  ker²³ and so the sum is direct and
im² b ³ ~ im²³ l im²³
The following theorem also describes the situation for the difference and
product. Proof in these cases is left for the exercises.
Theorem 2.26 Let = be a vector space over a field - of characteristic £  and
let  and  be projections.
1) The sum  b  is a projection if and only if    , in which case
im² b ³ ~ im²³ l im²³

and

ker² b ³ ~ ker²³ q ker²³

2) The difference  c  is a projection if and only if
 ~  ~ 

Linear Transformations

79

in which case
im² c ³ ~ im²³ q ker²³

and

ker² c ³ ~ ker²³ l im²³

3) If  and  commute, then  is a projection, in which case
im²³ ~ im²³ q im²³

and

ker²³ ~ ker²³ b ker²³

(Example 2.5 shows that the converse may be false.)

Topological Vector Spaces
This section is for readers with some familiarity with point-set topology.

The Definition
A pair ²= Á J ³ where = is a real vector space = and J is a topology on the set
= is called a topological vector space if the operations of addition
7¢ = d = ¦ = Á

7²#Á $³ ~ # b $

and scalar multiplication
C¢ s d = ¦ = Á

C²Á #³ ~ #

are continuous functions.

The Standard Topology on s
The vector space s is a topological vector space under the standard topology,
which is the topology for which the set of open rectangles
8 ~ ¸0 d Ä d 0  0 's are open intervals in s¹
is a base, that is, a subset of s is open if and only if it is a union of open
rectangles. The standard topology is also the topology induced by the Euclidean
metric on s , since an open rectangle is the union of Euclidean open balls and
an open ball is the union of open rectangles.
The standard topology on s has the property that the addition function
7¢ s d s ¦ s ¢ ²#Á $³ ¦ # b $
and the scalar multiplication function
C¢ s d s ¦ s ¢ ²Á #³ ¦ #
are continuous and so s is a topological vector space under this topology.
Also, the linear functionals  ¢ s ¦ s are continuous maps.
For example, to see that addition is continuous, if
²" Á Ã Á " ³ b ²# Á Ã Á # ³  ² Á  ³ d Ä d ²Á ³  8

then " b #  ² Á  ³ and so there is an    for which
²" c Á " b ³ b ²# c Á # b ³  ² Á  ³
for all . It follows that if
²" Á Ã Á " ³  0  ²" c Á " b ³ d Ä d ²" c Á " b ³  8
and
²# Á Ã Á # ³  1  ²# c Á # b ³ d Ä d ²# c Á # b ³  8
then

The Natural Topology on =
Now let = be a real vector space of dimension  and fix an ordered basis
8 ~ ²# Á Ã Á # ³ for = . We wish to show that there is precisely one topology J
on = for which ²= Á J ³ is a topological vector space and all linear functionals
are continuous. This topology is called the natural topology on = .
Our plan is to show that if ²= Á J ³ is a topological vector space and if all linear
functionals on = are continuous, then the coordinate map 8 ¢ =  s is a
homeomorphism. This implies that if J does exist, it must be unique. Then we
use  ~ 8c to move the standard topology from s to = , thus giving = a
topology J for which 8 is a homeomorphism. Finally, we show that ²= Á J ³ is
a topological vector space and that all linear functionals on = are continuous.
The first step is to show that if ²= Á J ³ is a topological vector space, then  is
continuous. Since  ~  where  ¢ s ¦ = is defined by
 ² Á Ã Á  ³ ~  #
it is sufficient to show that these maps are continuous. (The sum of continuous
maps is continuous.) Let 6 be an open set in J . Then
Cc ²6³ ~ ¸²Á %³  s d =  %  6¹
is open in s d = . This implies that if %  6, then there is an open interval
0  s containing  for which
0% ~ ¸ % 

 0¹  6

We need to show that the set c
 ²6³ is open. But

c
 ²6³ ~ ¸² Á Ã Á  ³  s   #  6¹
~ s d Ä d s d ¸  s   #  6¹ d s d Ä d s

In words, an -tuple ² Á Ã Á  ³ is in c
 ²6³ if the th coordinate  times # is

Linear Transformations

81

in 6. But if  #  6, then there is an open interval 0  s for which   0 and
0#  6. Hence, the entire open set
< ~sdÄdsd0 dsdÄds
where the factor 0 is in the th position is in c
 ²6³, that is,
² Á Ã Á  ³  <  c
 ²6³
Thus, c
 ²6³ is open and  , and therefore also , is continuous.
Next we show that if every linear functional on = is continuous under a
topology J on = , then the coordinate map  is continuous. If #  = denote by
´#µ8Á the th coordinate of ´#µ8 . The map ¢ = ¦ s defined by # ~ ´#µ8Á is a
linear functional and so is continuous by assumption. Hence, for any open
interval 0  s the set
( ~ ¸#  =  ´#µ8Á  0 ¹
is open. Now, if 0 are open intervals in s, then
c ²0 d Ä d 0 ³ ~ ¸#  =  ´#µ8  0 d Ä d 0 ¹ ~

(

is open. Thus,  is continuous.
We have shown that if a topology J has the property that ²= Á J ³ is a
topological vector space under which every linear functional is continuous, then
 and  ~ c are homeomorphisms. This means that if J exists, its open sets
must be the images under  of the open sets in the standard topology of s . It
remains to prove that the topology J on = that makes  a homeomorphism
makes ²= Á J ³ a topological vector space for which any linear functional  on =
is continuous.
The addition map on = is a composition
7 ~ c k 7Z k ² d ³
where 7Z ¢ s d s ¦ s is addition in s and since each of the maps on the
right is continuous, so is 7.
Similarly, scalar multiplication in = is
C ~ c k CZ k ² d ³
where CZ ¢ s d s ¦ s is scalar multiplication in s . Hence, C is
continuous.
Now let  be a linear functional. Since  is continuous if and only if  k c is
continuous, we can confine attention to = ~ s . In this case, if  Á Ã Á  is the
standard basis for s and ( ² ³(  4 for all , then for any

( ²%³( ~ c   ² ³c   ( (( ² ³(  4  ( (
Now, if (%(  °4 , then ( (  °4  and so ( ²%³(  , which implies that 
is continuous at % ~ .
According to the Riesz representation theorem (Theorem 9.18) and the Cauchy–
Schwarz inequality, we have
) ²%³)  )H ))%)
where 9  s . Hence, % ¦  implies  ²% ³ ¦  and so by linearity, % ¦ %
implies  ²% ³ ¦ % and so  is continuous at all %.
Theorem 2.27 Let = be a real vector space of dimension . There is a unique
topology on = , called the natural topology, for which = is a topological vector
space and for which all linear functionals on = are continuous. This topology is
determined by the fact that the coordinate map ¢ = ¦ s is a
homeomorphism, where s has the standard topology induced by the Euclidean
metric.

Linear Operators on = d
A linear operator  on a real vector space = can be extended to a linear operator
 d on the complexification = d by defining
 d ²" b #³ ~  ²"³ b  ²#³
Here are the basic properties of this complexification of  .
Theorem 2.28 If  Á   B²= ³, then
1) ² ³d ~  d ,   s
2) ² b ³d ~  d b d
3) ²³d ~  d d
4) ´ #µd ~  d ²#d ³.
Let us recall that for any ordered basis 8 for = and any vector #  = we have
´# b µcpx²8 ³ ~ ´#µ8
Now, if 8 is an ordered basis for = , then the th column of ´ µ8 is
´  µ8 ~ ´  b µcpx²8³ ~ ´ d ² b ³µcpx²8³
which is the th column of the coordinate matrix of  d with respect to the basis
cpx²8 ³. Thus we have the following theorem.

Linear Transformations

Theorem 2.29 Let   B²= ³ where = is a real vector space. The matrix of  d
with respect to the ordered basis cpx²8 ³ is equal to the matrix of  with respect
to the ordered basis 8 :
´ d µcpx²8³ ~ ´ µ8
Hence, if a real matrix ( represents a linear operator  on = , then ( also
represents the complexification  d of  on = d .

The Isomorphism Theorems

Quotient Spaces
Let : be a subspace of a vector space = . It is easy to see that the binary relation
on = defined by
"#

¯

"c#:

is an equivalence relation. When "  #, we say that " and # are congruent
modulo : . The term mod is used as a colloquialism for modulo and "  # is
often written
"  # mod :
When the subspace in question is clear, we will simply write "  #.
To see what the equivalence classes look like, observe that
´#µ ~ ¸"  =  "  #¹
~ ¸"  =  " c #  :¹
~ ¸"  =  " ~ # b for some  :¹
~ ¸# b   :¹
~#b:
The set
´#µ ~ # b : ~ ¸# b 

 :¹

is called a coset of : in = and # is called a coset representative for # b : .
(Thus, any member of a coset is a coset representative.)
The set of all cosets of : in = is denoted by
= °: ~ ¸# b :  #  = ¹
This is read “= mod : ” and is called the quotient space of = modulo : . Of

course, the term space is a hint that we intend to define vector space operations
on = °: .
The natural choice for these vector space operations is
²" b :³ b ²# b :³ ~ ²" b #³ b :
and
²" b :³ ~ ²"³ b :
but we must check that these operations are well-defined, that is,
1) " b : ~ " b :Á # b : ~ # b : ¬ ²" b # ³ b : ~ ²" b # ³ b :
2) " b : ~ " b : ¬ " b : ~ " b :
Equivalently, the equivalence relation  must be consistent with the vector
space operations on = , that is,
3) "  " Á #  # ¬ ²" b # ³  ²" b # ³
4) "  " ¬ "  "
This senario is a recurring one in algebra. An equivalence relation on an
algebraic structure, such as a group, ring, module or vector space is called a
congruence relation if it preserves the algebraic operations. In the case of a
vector space, these are conditions 3) and 4) above.
These conditions follow easily from the fact that : is a subspace, for if "  "
and #  # , then
" c "  :Á # c #  : ¬ ²" c " ³ b ²# c # ³  :
¬ ²" b # ³ c ²" b # ³  :
¬ " b #  " b #
which verifies both conditions at once. We leave it to the reader to verify that
= °: is indeed a vector space over - under these well-defined operations.
Actually, we are lucky here: For any subspace : of = , the quotient = °: is a
vector space under the natural operations. In the case of groups, not all
subgroups have this property. Indeed, it is precisely the normal subgroups 5 of
. that have the property that the quotient .°5 is a group. Also, for rings, it is
precisely the ideals (not the subrings) that have the property that the quotient is
a ring.
Let us summarize.
