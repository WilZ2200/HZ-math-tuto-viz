Preliminaries

In this chapter, we briefly discuss some topics that are needed for the sequel.
This chapter should be skimmed quickly and used primarily as a reference.

Part 1 Preliminaries
Multisets
The following simple concept is much more useful than its infrequent
appearance would indicate.
Definition Let : be a nonempty set. A multiset 4 with underlying set : is a
set of ordered pairs
4 ~ ¸²  Á  ³ 

b
  :Á   { Á  £

 for  £ ¹

where {b ~ ¸Á Á Ã ¹. The number  is referred to as the multiplicity of the
elements  in 4 . If the underlying set of a multiset is finite, we say that the
multiset is finite. The size of a finite multiset 4 is the sum of the multiplicities
of all of its elements.
For example, 4 ~ ¸²Á ³Á ²Á ³Á ²Á ³¹ is a multiset with underlying set
: ~ ¸Á Á ¹. The element  has multiplicity . One often writes out the
elements of a multiset according to multiplicities, as in 4 ~ ¸Á Á Á Á Á ¹.
Of course, two mutlisets are equal if their underlying sets are equal and if the
multiplicity of each element in the common underlying set is the same in both
multisets.

Matrices
The set of  d  matrices with entries in a field - is denoted by CÁ ²- ³ or
by CÁ when the field does not require mention. The set CÁ ²< ³ is denoted
by C ²- ³ or C À If (  C, the ²Á ³th entry of ( will be denoted by (Á .
The identity matrix of size  d  is denoted by 0 . The elements of the base

field - are called scalars. We expect that the reader is familiar with the basic
properties of matrices, including matrix addition and multiplication.
The main diagonal of an  d  matrix ( is the sequence of entries
(Á Á (Á Á Ã Á (Á
where  ~ min¸Á ¹.
Definition The transpose of (  CÁ is the matrix (! defined by
²(! ³Á ~ (Á
A matrix ( is symmetric if ( ~ (! and skew-symmetric if (! ~ c(.
Theorem 0.1 (Properties of the transpose) Let (, )  CÁ . Then
1) ²(! ³! ~ (
2) ²( b )³! ~ (! b ) !
3) ²(³! ~ (! for all   4) ²()³! ~ ) ! (! provided that the product () is defined
5) det²(! ³ ~ det²(³.

Partitioning and Matrix Multiplication
Let 4 be a matrix of size  d . If )  ¸Á Ã Á ¹ and *  ¸Á Ã Á ¹, then
the submatrix 4 ´)Á *µ is the matrix obtained from 4 by keeping only the
rows with index in ) and the columns with index in * . Thus, all other rows and
columns are discarded and 4 ´)Á *µ has size () ( d (* (.
Suppose that 4  CÁ and 5  CÁ . Let
1) F ~ ¸) Á Ã Á ) ¹ be a partition of ¸Á Ã Á ¹
2) G ~ ¸* Á Ã Á * ¹ be a partition of ¸Á Ã Á ¹
3) H ~ ¸+ Á Ã Á + ¹ be a partition of ¸Á Ã Á ¹
(Partitions are defined formally later in this chapter.) Then it is a very useful fact
that matrix multiplication can be performed at the block level as well as at the
entry level. In particular, we have
´4 5 µ´) Á + µ ~  4 ´) Á * µ5 ´* Á + µ
* G

When the partitions in question contain only single-element blocks, this is
precisely the usual formula for matrix multiplication

where each ) is square and  is a zero submatrix, is said to be a block
diagonal matrix.

Elementary Row Operations
Recall that there are three types of elementary row operations. Type 1
operations consist of multiplying a row of ( by a nonzero scalar. Type 2
operations consist of interchanging two rows of (. Type 3 operations consist of
adding a scalar multiple of one row of ( to another row of (.
If we perform an elementary operation of type  to an identity matrix 0 , the
result is called an elementary matrix of type  . It is easy to see that all
elementary matrices are invertible.
In order to perform an elementary row operation on (  CÁ we can perform
that operation on the identity 0 , to obtain an elementary matrix , and then take
the product ,(. Note that multiplying on the right by , has the effect of
performing column operations.
Definition A matrix 9 is said to be in reduced row echelon form if
1) All rows consisting only of 's appear at the bottom of the matrix.
2) In any nonzero row, the first nonzero entry is a . This entry is called a
leading entry.
3) For any two consecutive rows, the leading entry of the lower row is to the
right of the leading entry of the upper row.
4) Any column that contains a leading entry has 's in all other positions.
Here are the basic facts concerning reduced row echelon form.

4

Advanced Linear Algebra

Theorem 0.2 Matrices (Á )  CÁ are row equivalent, denoted by (  ) ,
if either one can be obtained from the other by a series of elementary row
operations.
1) Row equivalence is an equivalence relation. That is,
a) (  (
b) (  ) ¬ )  (
c) (  ) , )  * ¬ (  * .
2) A matrix ( is row equivalent to one and only one matrix 9 that is in
reduced row echelon form. The matrix 9 is called the reduced row
echelon form of (. Furthermore,
9 ~ , Ä, (
where , are the elementary matrices required to reduce ( to reduced row
echelon form.
3) ( is invertible if and only if its reduced row echelon form is an identity
matrix. Hence, a matrix is invertible if and only if it is the product of
elementary matrices.
The following definition is probably well known to the reader.
Definition A square matrix is upper triangular if all of its entries below the
main diagonal are . Similarly, a square matrix is lower triangular if all of its
entries above the main diagonal are . A square matrix is diagonal if all of its
entries off the main diagonal are .

Determinants
We assume that the reader is familiar with the following basic properties of
determinants.
Theorem 0.3 Let (  CÁ ²- ³. Then det²(³ is an element of - . Furthermore,
1) For any )  C ²- ³,
det²()³ ~ det²(³det²)³
2) ( is nonsingular (invertible) if and only if det²(³ £ .
3) The determinant of an upper triangular or lower triangular matrix is the
product of the entries on its main diagonal.

Polynomials
The set of all polynomials in the variable % with coefficients from a field - is
denoted by - ´%µ. If ²%³  - ´%µ, we say that ²%³ is a polynomial over - . If
²%³ ~  b  % b Ä b  %
is a polynomial with  £ , then  is called the leading coefficient of ²%³
and the degree of ²%³ is , written deg ²%³ ~ . For convenience, the degree
of the zero polynomial is cB. A polynomial is monic if its leading coefficient
is .
Theorem 0.4 (Division algorithm) Let  ²%³Á ²%³  - ´%µ where deg ²%³  .
Then there exist unique polynomials ²%³Á ²%³  - ´%µ for which
 ²%³ ~ ²%³²%³ b ²%³
where ²%³ ~  or   deg ²%³  deg ²%³.
If ²%³ divides ²%³, that is, if there exists a polynomial  ²%³ for which
²%³ ~  ²%³²%³
then we write ²%³  ²%³. A nonzero polynomial ²%³  - ´%µ is said to split
over - if ²%³ can be written as a product of linear factors
²%³ ~ ²% c  ³Ä²% c  ³
where   - .
Theorem 0.5 Let  ²%³Á ²%³  - ´%µ. The greatest common divisor of  ²%³ and
²%³, denoted by gcd² ²%³Á ²%³³, is the unique monic polynomial ²%³ over for which
1) ²%³   ²%³ and ²%³  ²%³
2) if ²%³   ²%³ and ²%³  ²%³ then ²%³  ²%³.
Furthermore, there exist polynomials ²%³ and ²%³ over - for which
gcd² ²%³Á ²%³³ ~ ²%³ ²%³ b ²%³²%³
Definition The polynomials  ²%³Á ²%³  - ´%µ are relatively prime if
gcd² ²%³Á ²%³³ ~ . In particular,  ²%³ and ²%³ are relatively prime if and
only if there exist polynomials ²%³ and ²%³ over - for which
²%³ ²%³ b ²%³²%³ ~ 
Definition A nonconstant polynomial  ²%³  - ´%µ is irreducible if whenever
 ²%³ ~ ²%³²%³, then one of ²%³ and ²%³ must be constant.
The following two theorems support the view that irreducible polynomials
behave like prime numbers.

6

Advanced Linear Algebra

Theorem 0.6 A nonconstant polynomial  ²%³ is irreducible if and only if it has
the property that whenever  ²%³  ²%³²%³, then either  ²%³  ²%³ or
 ²%³  ²%³.
Theorem 0.7 Every nonconstant polynomial in - ´%µ can be written as a product
of irreducible polynomials. Moreover, this expression is unique up to order of
the factors and multiplication by a scalar.

Functions
To set our notation, we should make a few comments about functions.
Definition Let  ¢ : ¦ ; be a function from a set : to a set ; .
1) The domain of  is the set : and the range of  is ; .
2) The image of  is the set im² ³ ~ ¸ ² ³   :¹.
3)  is injective (one-to-one), or an injection, if % £ & ¬  ²%³ £  ²&³.
4)  is surjective (onto ; ), or a surjection, if im² ³ ~ ; .
5)  is bijective, or a bijection, if it is both injective and surjective.
6) Assuming that   ; , the support of  is
supp² ³ ~ ¸  :   ² ³ £ ¹
If  ¢ : ¦ ; is injective, then its inverse  c ¢ im² ³ ¦ : exists and is welldefined as a function on im² ³.
It will be convenient to apply  to subsets of : and ; . In particular, if ?  :
and if @  ; , we set
 ²?³ ~ ¸ ²%³  %  ?¹
and
 c ²@ ³ ~ ¸  :   ² ³  @ ¹
Note that the latter is defined even if  is not injective.
Let  ¢ : ¦ ; . If (  : , the restriction of  to ( is the function  O( ¢ ( ¦ ;
defined by
 O( ²³ ~  ²³
for all   (. Clearly, the restriction of an injective map is injective.
In the other direction, if  ¢ : ¦ ; and if :  < , then an extension of  to < is
a function  ¢ < ¦ ; for which  O: ~  .

Equivalence Relations
The concept of an equivalence relation plays a major role in the study of
matrices and linear transformations.
Definition Let : be a nonempty set. A binary relation  on : is called an
equivalence relation on : if it satisfies the following conditions:
1) (Reflexivity)

for all   : .
2) (Symmetry)
¬
for all Á   : .
3) (Transitivity)
  Á    ¬   
for all Á Á   : .
Definition Let  be an equivalence relation on : . For   : , the set of all
elements equivalent to  is denoted by
´µ ~ ¸  :    ¹
and called the equivalence class of .
Theorem 0.8 Let  be an equivalence relation on : . Then
1)   ´µ ¯   ´µ ¯ ´µ ~ ´µ
2) For any Á   : , we have either ´µ ~ ´µ or ´µ q ´µ ~ J.
Definition A partition of a nonempty set : is a collection ¸( Á Ã Á ( ¹ of
nonempty subsets of : , called the blocks of the partition, for which
1) ( q ( ~ J for all  £ 
2 ) : ~ ( r Ä r (  .
The following theorem sheds considerable light on the concept of an
equivalence relation.
Theorem 0.9
1) Let  be an equivalence relation on : . Then the set of distinct equivalence
classes with respect to  are the blocks of a partition of : .
2) Conversely, if F is a partition of : , the binary relation  defined by
   if  and  lie in the same block of F

8

Advanced Linear Algebra

is an equivalence relation on : , whose equivalence classes are the blocks
of F .
This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between equivalence relations on
: and partitions of : .
The most important problem related to equivalence relations is that of finding an
efficient way to determine when two elements are equivalent. Unfortunately, in
most cases, the definition does not provide an efficient test for equivalence and
so we are led to the following concepts.
Definition Let  be an equivalence relation on : . A function  ¢ : ¦ ; , where
; is any set, is called an invariant of  if it is constant on the equivalence
classes of  , that is,
   ¬  ²³ ~  ²³
and a complete invariant if it is constant and distinct on the equivalence
classes of  , that is,
   ¯  ²³ ~  ²³
A collection ¸ Á Ã Á  ¹ of invariants is called a complete system of
invariants if
   ¯  ²³ ~  ²³ for all  ~ Á Ã Á 
Definition Let  be an equivalence relation on : . A subset *  : is said to be
a set of canonical forms (or just a canonical form) for  if for every  : ,
there is exactly one   * such that   . Put another way, each equivalence
class under  contains exactly one member of * .
Example 0.1 Define a binary relation  on - ´%µ by letting ²%³  ²%³ if and
only if ²%³ ~ ²%³ for some nonzero constant   - . This is easily seen to be
an equivalence relation. The function that assigns to each polynomial its degree
is an invariant, since
²%³  ²%³ ¬ deg²²%³³ ~ deg²²%³³
However, it is not a complete invariant, since there are inequivalent polynomials
with the same degree. The set of all monic polynomials is a set of canonical
forms for this equivalence relation.
Example 0.2 We have remarked that row equivalence is an equivalence relation
on CÁ ²- ³. Moreover, the subset of reduced row echelon form matrices is a
set of canonical forms for row equivalence, since every matrix is row equivalent
to a unique matrix in reduced row echelon form.

Preliminaries

Example 0.3 Two matrices (, )  C ²- ³ are row equivalent if and only if
there is an invertible matrix 7 such that ( ~ 7 ) . Similarly, ( and ) are
column equivalent, that is, ( can be reduced to ) using elementary column
operations, if and only if there exists an invertible matrix 8 such that ( ~ )8.
Two matrices ( and ) are said to be equivalent if there exist invertible
matrices 7 and 8 for which
( ~ 7 )8
Put another way, ( and ) are equivalent if ( can be reduced to ) by
performing a series of elementary row and/or column operations. (The use of the
term equivalent is unfortunate, since it applies to all equivalence relations, not
just this one. However, the terminology is standard, so we use it here.)
It is not hard to see that an  d  matrix 9 that is in both reduced row echelon
form and reduced column echelon form must have the block form
1 ~ >

0
cÁ

Ác
cÁc ?block

We leave it to the reader to show that every matrix ( in C is equivalent to
exactly one matrix of the form 1 and so the set of these matrices is a set of
canonical forms for equivalence. Moreover, the function  defined by
 ²(³ ~  , where (  1 , is a complete invariant for equivalence.
Since the rank of 1 is  and since neither row nor column operations affect the
rank, we deduce that the rank of ( is  . Hence, rank is a complete invariant for
equivalence. In other words, two matrices are equivalent if and only if they have
the same rank.
Example 0.4 Two matrices (, )  C ²- ³ are said to be similar if there exists
an invertible matrix 7 such that
( ~ 7 )7 c
Similarity is easily seen to be an equivalence relation on C . As we will learn,
two matrices are similar if and only if they represent the same linear operators
on a given -dimensional vector space = . Hence, similarity is extremely
important for studying the structure of linear operators. One of the main goals of
this book is to develop canonical forms for similarity.
We leave it to the reader to show that the determinant function and the trace
function are invariants for similarity. However, these two invariants do not, in
general, form a complete system of invariants.
Example 0.5 Two matrices (, )  C ²- ³ are said to be congruent if there
exists an invertible matrix 7 for which

10

Advanced Linear Algebra

( ~ 7 )7 !
where 7 ! is the transpose of 7 . This relation is easily seen to be an equivalence
relation and we will devote some effort to finding canonical forms for
congruence. For some base fields - (such as s, d or a finite field), this is
relatively easy to do, but for other base fields (such as r), it is extremely
difficult.

Zorn's Lemma
In order to show that any vector space has a basis, we require a result known as
Zorn's lemma. To state this lemma, we need some preliminary definitions.
Definition A partially ordered set is a pair ²7 Á  ³ where 7 is a nonempty set
and  is a binary relation called a partial order, read “less than or equal to,”
with the following properties:
1) (Reflexivity) For all   7 ,

2) (Antisymmetry) For all Á   7 ,
   and    implies  ~ 
3) (Transitivity) For all Á Á   7 ,
   and    implies   
Partially ordered sets are also called posets.
It is customary to use a phrase such as “Let 7 be a partially ordered set” when
the partial order is understood. Here are some key terms related to partially
ordered sets.
Definition Let 7 be a partially ordered set.
1) The maximum (largest, top) element of 7 , should it exist, is an element
4  7 with the property that all elements of 7 are less than or equal to
4 , that is,
7 ¬4
Similarly, the mimimum (least, smallest, bottom) element of 7 , should it
exist, is an element 5  7 with the property that all elements of 7 are
greater than or equal to 5 , that is,
7 ¬5 
2) A maximal element is an element   7 with the property that there is no
larger element in 7 , that is,
  7Á   ¬  ~ 

Preliminaries

11

Similarly, a minimal element is an element   7 with the property that
there is no smaller element in 7 , that is,
  7Á   ¬  ~ 
3) Let Á   7 . Then "  7 is an upper bound for  and  if
  " and   "
The unique smallest upper bound for  and , if it exists, is called the least
upper bound of  and  and is denoted by lub¸Á ¹.
4) Let Á   7 . Then M  7 is a lower bound for  and  if
M   and M  
The unique largest lower bound for  and , if it exists, is called the
greatest lower bound of  and  and is denoted by glb¸Á ¹.
Let : be a subset of a partially ordered set 7 . We say that an element "  7 is
an upper bound for : if  " for all  : . Lower bounds are defined
similarly.
Note that in a partially ordered set, it is possible that not all elements are
comparable. In other words, it is possible to have %Á &  7 with the property
that % 
 & and & 
 %.
Definition A partially ordered set in which every pair of elements is
comparable is called a totally ordered set, or a linearly ordered set. Any
totally ordered subset of a partially ordered set 7 is called a chain in 7 .
Example 0.6
1) The set s of real numbers, with the usual binary relation  , is a partially
ordered set. It is also a totally ordered set. It has no maximal elements.
2) The set o ~ ¸Á Á Ã ¹ of natural numbers, together with the binary
relation of divides, is a partially ordered set. It is customary to write   
to indicate that  divides . The subset : of o consisting of all powers of 
is a totally ordered subset of o, that is, it is a chain in o. The set
7 ~ ¸Á Á Á Á Á  ¹ is a partially ordered set under  . It has two maximal
elements, namely and  . The subset 8 ~ ¸Á Á Á Á ¹ is a partially
ordered set in which every element is both maximal and minimal!
3) Let : be any set and let F ²:³ be the power set of : , that is, the set of all
subsets of : . Then F ²:³, together with the subset relation  , is a partially
ordered set.
Now we can state Zorn's lemma, which gives a condition under which a
partially ordered set has a maximal element.

12

Advanced Linear Algebra

Theorem 0.10 (Zorn's lemma) If 7 is a partially ordered set in which every
chain has an upper bound, then 7 has a maximal element.
We will use Zorn's lemma to prove that every vector space has a basis. Zorn's
lemma is equivalent to the famous axiom of choice. As such, it is not subject to
proof from the other axioms of ordinary (ZF) set theory. Zorn's lemma has many
important equivalancies, one of which is the well-ordering principle. A well
ordering on a nonempty set ? is a total order on ? with the property that every
nonempty subset of ? has a least element.
Theorem 0.11 (Well-ordering principle) Every nonempty set has a well
ordering.

Cardinality
Two sets : and ; have the same cardinality, written
(: ( ~ (; (
if there is a bijective function (a one-to-one correspondence) between the sets.
The reader is probably aware of the fact that
({( ~ (o( and (r( ~ (o(
where o denotes the natural numbers, { the integers and r the rational
numbers.
If : is in one-to-one correspondence with a subset of ; , we write (: (  (; (. If
: is in one-to-one correspondence with a proper subset of ; but not all of ; ,
then we write (: (  (; (. The second condition is necessary, since, for instance,
o is in one-to-one correspondence with a proper subset of { and yet o is also in
one-to-one correspondence with { itself. Hence, (o( ~ ({(.
This is not the place to enter into a detailed discussion of cardinal numbers. The
intention here is that the cardinality of a set, whatever that is, represents the
“size” of the set. It is actually easier to talk about two sets having the same, or
different, size (cardinality) than it is to explicitly define the size (cardinality) of
a given set.
Be that as it may, we associate to each set : a cardinal number, denoted by (: (
or card²:³, that is intended to measure the size of the set. Actually, cardinal
numbers are just very special types of sets. However, we can simply think of
them as vague amorphous objects that measure the size of sets.
Definition
1) A set is finite if it can be put in one-to-one correspondence with a set of the
form { ~ ¸Á Á Ã Á  c ¹, for some nonnegative integer . A set that is

not finite is infinite. The cardinal number (or cardinality) of a finite set is
just the number of elements in the set.
2) The cardinal number of the set o of natural numbers is L (read “aleph
nought”), where L is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Hence,
(o( ~ ({( ~ (r( ~ L
3) Any set with cardinality L is called a countably infinite set and any finite
or countably infinite set is called a countable set. An infinite set that is not
countable is said to be uncountable.
Since it can be shown that (s(  (o(, the real numbers are uncountable.
If : and ; are finite sets, then it is well known that
(: (  (; ( and (; (  (: ( ¬ (: ( ~ (; (
The first part of the next theorem tells us that this is also true for infinite sets.
The reader will no doubt recall that the power set F²:³ of a set : is the set of
all subsets of : . For finite sets, the power set of : is always bigger than the set
itself. In fact,
(: ( ~  ¬ (F ²:³( ~ 
The second part of the next theorem says that the power set of any set : is
bigger (has larger cardinality) than : itself. On the other hand, the third part of
this theorem says that, for infinite sets : , the set of all finite subsets of : is the
same size as : .

Proof. We prove only parts 1) and 2). Let  ¢ : ¦ ; be an injective function
from : into ; and let ¢ ; ¦ : be an injective function from ; into : . We
want to use these functions to create a bijective function from : to ; . For this
purpose, we make the following definitions. The descendants of an element
 : are the elements obtained by repeated alternate applications of the
functions  and , namely

If ! is a descendant of , then is an ancestor of !. Descendants and ancestors
of elements of ; are defined similarly.
Now, by tracing an element's ancestry to its beginning, we find that there are
three possibilities: the element may originate in : , or in ; , or it may have no
point of origin. Accordingly, we can write : as the union of three disjoint sets
I: ~ ¸  :  originates in :¹
I; ~ ¸  :  originates in ; ¹
IB ~ ¸  :  has no originator¹
Similarly, ; is the disjoint union of J: , J; and JB .
Now, the restriction
 OI: ¢ I: ¦ J:
is a bijection. To see this, note that if !  J: , then ! originated in : and
therefore must have the form  ² ³ for some  : . But ! and its ancestor have
the same point of origin and so !  J: implies  I: . Thus,  OI: is surjective
and hence bijective. We leave it to the reader to show that the functions
²OJ; ³c ¢ I; ¦ J; and  OIB ¢ IB ¦ JB
are also bijections. Putting these three bijections together gives a bijection
between : and ; . Hence, (: ( ~ (; (, as desired.
We now prove Cantor's theorem. The map ¢ : ¦ F ²:³ defined by ² ³ ~ ¸ ¹
is an injection from : to F ²:³ and so (: (  (F ²:³(. To complete the proof we
must show that no injective map  ¢ : ¦ F ²:³ can be surjective. To this end, let

We claim that ? is not in im² ³. For suppose that ? ~  ²%³ for some %  : .
Then if %  ? , we have by the definition of ? that % ¤ ? . On the other hand, if
% ¤ ? , we have again by the definition of ? that %  ? . This contradiction
implies that ? ¤ im² ³ and so  is not surjective.
Cardinal Arithmetic
Now let us define addition, multiplication and exponentiation of cardinal
numbers. If : and ; are sets, the cartesian product : d ; is the set of all
ordered pairs

The set of all functions from ; to : is denoted by : ; .

Definition Let  and  denote cardinal numbers. Let : and ; be disjoint sets
for which (: ( ~  and (; ( ~ .
1) The sum  b  is the cardinal number of : r ; .
2) The product  is the cardinal number of : d ; .
3) The power  is the cardinal number of : ; .
We will not go into the details of why these definitions make sense. (For
instance, they seem to depend on the sets : and ; , but in fact they do not.) It
can be shown, using these definitions, that cardinal addition and multiplication
are associative and commutative and that multiplication distributes over
addition.
Theorem 0.13 Let ,  and  be cardinal numbers. Then the following
properties hold:
1) (Associativity)
 b ² b ³ ~ ² b ³ b  and ²³ ~ ²³
2) (Commutativity)
 b  ~  b  and  ~ 
3) (Distributivity)

4) (Properties of Exponents)
a) b ~  
b) ² ³ ~ 
c) ²³ ~  
On the other hand, the arithmetic of cardinal numbers can seem a bit strange, as
the next theorem shows.
Theorem 0.14 Let  and  be cardinal numbers, at least one of which is
infinite. Then
 b  ~  ~ max¸Á ¹
It is not hard to see that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the power
set F²:³ of a set : and the set of all functions from : to ¸Á ¹. This leads to
the following theorem.

We have already observed that (o( ~ L . It can be shown that L is the smallest
infinite cardinal, that is,

It can also be shown that the set s of real numbers is in one-to-one

(s( ~ L
The set of all points on the real line is sometimes called the continuum and so
L is sometimes called the power of the continuum and denoted by  .
Theorem 0.14 shows that cardinal addition and multiplication have a kind of
“absorption” quality, which makes it hard to produce larger cardinals from
smaller ones. The next theorem demonstrates this more dramatically.
Theorem 0.16
1) Addition applied a countable number of times or multiplication applied a
finite number of times to the cardinal number L , does not yield anything
more than L . Specifically, for any nonzero   o, we have
L h L ~ L and L ~ L
2) Addition and multiplication applied a countable number of times to the
cardinal number L does not yield more than L . Specifically, we have
L h L ~ L and ²L ³L ~ L
Using this theorem, we can establish other relationships, such as
L  ²L ³L  ²L ³L ~ L
which, by the Schröder–Bernstein theorem, implies that
²L ³L ~ L
We mention that the problem of evaluating  in general is a very difficult one
and would take us far beyond the scope of this book.
We will have use for the following reasonable-sounding result, whose proof is
omitted.

Let us conclude by describing the cardinality of some famous sets.

Part 2 Algebraic Structures
We now turn to a discussion of some of the many algebraic structures that play a
role in the study of linear algebra.

Groups
Definition A group is a nonempty set ., together with a binary operation
denoted by *, that satisfies the following properties:
1) (Associativity) For all Á Á   .,
²i³i ~ i²i³
2) (Identity) There exists an element   . for which
i ~ i ~ 
for all   ..
3) (Inverses) For each   ., there is an element c  . for which
ic ~ c i ~ 
Definition A group . is abelian, or commutative, if
i ~ i
for all Á   . . When a group is abelian, it is customary to denote the
operation i by +, thus writing i as  b  . It is also customary to refer to the
identity as the zero element and to denote the inverse c by c, referred to as
the negative of .
Example 0.7 The set < of all bijective functions from a set : to : is a group
under composition of functions. However, in general, it is not abelian.
Example 0.8 The set CÁ ²- ³ is an abelian group under addition of matrices.
The identity is the zero matrix 0Á of size  d . The set C ²- ³ is not a
group under multiplication of matrices, since not all matrices have multiplicative

18

Advanced Linear Algebra

inverses. However, the set of invertible matrices of size  d  is a (nonabelian)
group under multiplication.
A group . is finite if it contains only a finite number of elements. The
cardinality of a finite group . is called its order and is denoted by ².³ or
simply (.(. Thus, for example, { ~ ¸Á Á Ã Á  c ¹ is a finite group under
addition modulo , but CÁ ²s³ is not finite.
Definition A subgroup of a group . is a nonempty subset : of . that is a
group in its own right, using the same operations as defined on . .
Cyclic Groups
If  is a formal symbol, we can define a group . to be the set of all integral
powers of :
. ~ ¸    {¹
where the product is defined by the formal rules of exponents:
  ~ b
This group is denoted by º» and called the cyclic group generated by . The
identity of º» is  ~  . In general, a group . is cyclic if it has the form
. ~ º» for some   ..
We can also create a finite group * ²³ of arbitrary positive order  by
declaring that  ~ . Thus,
* ²³ ~ ¸ ~  Á Á  Á Ã Á c ¹
where the product is defined by the formal rules of exponents, followed by
reduction modulo :
  ~ ²b³ mod 
This defines a group of order , called a cyclic group of order . The inverse
of  is ²c³ mod  .

Rings
Definition A ring is a nonempty set 9 , together with two binary operations,
called addition (denoted by b ) and multiplication (denoted by juxtaposition),
for which the following hold:
1) 9 is an abelian group under addition
2) (Associativity) For all Á Á   9 ,
²³ ~ ²³

Preliminaries

19

3) (Distributivity) For all Á Á   9 ,
² b ³ ~  b  and ² b ³ ~  b 
A ring 9 is said to be commutative if  ~  for all Á   9 . If a ring 9
contains an element  with the property that
 ~  ~ 
for all   9 , we say that 9 is a ring with identity. The identity  is usually
denoted by .
A field - is a commutative ring with identity in which each nonzero element
has a multiplicative inverse, that is, if   - is nonzero, then there is a   for which  ~ .
Example 0.9 The set { ~ ¸Á Á Ã Á c¹ is a commutative ring under
addition and multiplication modulo 
 l  ~ ² b ³ mod Á

 p  ~  mod 

The element   { is the identity.
Example 0.10 The set , of even integers is a commutative ring under the usual
operations on {, but it has no identity.
Example 0.11 The set C ²- ³ is a noncommutative ring under matrix addition
and multiplication. The identity matrix 0 is the identity for C ²- ³.
Example 0.12 Let - be a field. The set - ´%µ of all polynomials in a single
variable %, with coefficients in - , is a commutative ring under the usual
operations of polynomial addition and multiplication. What is the identity for
- ´%µ? Similarly, the set - ´% Á Ã Á % µ of polynomials in  variables is a
commutative ring under the usual addition and multiplication of polynomials.
Definition If 9 and : are rings, then a function ¢ 9 ¦ : is a ring
homomorphism if
² b ³ ~  b 
²³ ~ ²³²³
 ~ 
for all Á   9 .
Definition A subring of a ring 9 is a subset : of 9 that is a ring in its own
right, using the same operations as defined on 9 and having the same
multiplicative identity as 9 .

20

Advanced Linear Algebra

The condition that a subring : have the same multiplicative identity as 9 is
required. For example, the set : of all  d  matrices of the form
( ~ >





?

for   - is a ring under addition and multiplication of matrices (isomorphic to
- ). The multiplicative identity in : is the matrix ( , which is not the identity 0
of CÁ ²- ³. Hence, : is a ring under the same operations as CÁ ²- ³ but it is
not a subring of CÁ ²- ³.
Applying the definition is not generally the easiest way to show that a subset of
a ring is a subring. The following characterization is usually easier to apply.
Theorem 0.19 A nonempty subset : of a ring 9 is a subring if and only if
1) The multiplicative identity 9 of 9 is in :
2) : is closed under subtraction, that is,
Á   : ¬  c   :
3) : is closed under multiplication, that is,
Á   : ¬   :
Ideals
Rings have another important substructure besides subrings.
Definition Let 9 be a ring. A nonempty subset ? of 9 is called an ideal if
1) ? is a subgroup of the abelian group 9, that is, ? is closed under
subtraction:
Á   ? ¬  c   ?
2) ? is closed under multiplication by any ring element, that is,
  ? Á   9 ¬   ? and   ?
Note that if an ideal ? contains the unit element , then ? ~ 9 .
Example 0.13 Let ²%³ be a polynomial in - ´%µ. The set of all multiples of
²%³,
º²%³» ~ ¸²%³²%³  ²%³  - ´%µ¹
is an ideal in - ´%µ, called the ideal generated by ²%³.
Definition Let : be a subset of a ring 9 with identity. The set

Preliminaries

21

of all finite linear combinations of elements of : , with coefficients in 9 , is an
ideal in 9 , called the ideal generated by : . It is the smallest (in the sense of set
inclusion) ideal of 9 containing : . If : ~ ¸  Á Ã Á  ¹ is a finite set, we write
º  Á Ã Á  » ~ ¸  b Ä b      9Á   :¹
Note that in the previous definition, we require that 9 have an identity. This is
to ensure that :  º:».
Theorem 0.20 Let 9 be a ring.
1) The intersection of any collection ¸?    2¹ of ideals is an ideal.
2) If ?  ?  Ä is an ascending sequence of ideals, each one contained in
the next, then the union ? is also an ideal.
3) More generally, if
9 ~ ¸?    0¹
is a chain of ideals in 9 , then the union @ ~ 0 ? is also an ideal in 9 .
Proof. To prove 1), let @ ~ ? . Then if Á   @ , we have Á   ? for all
  2 . Hence,  c   ? for all   2 and so  c   @ . Hence, @ is closed
under subtraction. Also, if   9 , then   ? for all   2 and so   @ . Of
course, part 2) is a special case of part 3). To prove 3), if Á   @ , then   ?
and   ? for some Á   0 . Since one of ? and ? is contained in the other, we
may assume that ?  ? . It follows that Á   ? and so  c   ?  @ and if
  9 , then   ?  @ . Thus @ is an ideal.
Note that in general, the union of ideals is not an ideal. However, as we have
just proved, the union of any chain of ideals is an ideal.
Quotient Rings and Maximal Ideals
Let : be a subset of a commutative ring 9 with identity. Let  be the binary
relation on 9 defined by
 ¯ c :
It is easy to see that  is an equivalence relation. When    , we say that 
and  are congruent modulo : . The term “mod” is used as a colloquialism for
modulo and    is often written
   mod :
As shorthand, we write    .

22

Advanced Linear Algebra

To see what the equivalence classes look like, observe that
´µ ~ ¸  9    ¹
~ ¸  9   c   :¹
~ ¸  9   ~  b for some  :¹
~ ¸ b   :¹
~b:
The set
 b : ~ ¸ b 

 :¹

is called a coset of : in 9 . The element  is called a coset representative for
 b :.
Thus, the equivalence classes for congruence mod : are the cosets  b : of :
in 9 . The set of all cosets is denoted by
9°: ~ ¸ b :    9¹
This is read “9 mod : .” We would like to place a ring structure on 9°: .
Indeed, if : is a subgroup of the abelian group 9, then 9°: is easily seen to be
an abelian group as well under coset addition defined by
² b :³ b ² b :³ ~ ² b ³ b :
In order for the product
² b :³² b :³ ~  b :
to be well-defined, we must have
 b : ~  Z b : ¬  b : ~  Z b :
or, equivalently,
 c  Z  : ¬ ² c  Z ³  :
But  c  Z may be any element of : and  may be any element of 9 and so this
condition implies that : must be an ideal. Conversely, if : is an ideal, then
coset multiplication is well defined.
Theorem 0.21 Let 9 be a commutative ring with identity. Then the quotient
9°? is a ring under coset addition and multiplication if and only if ? is an
ideal of 9 . In this case, 9°? is called the quotient ring of 9 modulo ? , where
addition and multiplication are defined by
² b :³ b ² b :³ ~ ² b ³ b :
² b :³² b :³ ~  b :

Definition An ideal ? in a ring 9 is a maximal ideal if ? £ 9 and if whenever
@ is an ideal satisfying ?  @  9 , then either @ ~ ? or @ ~ 9 .
Here is one reason why maximal ideals are important.
Theorem 0.22 Let 9 be a commutative ring with identity. Then the quotient
ring 9°? is a field if and only if ? is a maximal ideal.
Proof. First, note that for any ideal ? of 9 , the ideals of 9°? are precisely the
quotients @ °? where @ is an ideal for which ?  @  9. It is clear that @ °?
is an ideal of 9°? . Conversely, if AZ is an ideal of 9°? , then let
A ~ ¸  9   b ?  AZ ¹
It is easy to see that A is an ideal of 9 for which ?  A  9 .
Next, observe that a commutative ring : with identity is a field if and only if :
has no nonzero proper ideals. For if : is a field and ? is an ideal of :
containing a nonzero element , then  ~ c   ? and so ? ~ : . Conversely,
if : has no nonzero proper ideals and  £  : , then the ideal º » must be :
and so there is an   : for which  ~ . Hence, : is a field.
Putting these two facts together proves the theorem.
The following result says that maximal ideals always exist.
Theorem 0.23 Any nonzero commutative ring 9 with identity contains a
maximal ideal.
Proof. Since 9 is not the zero ring, the ideal ¸¹ is a proper ideal of 9 . Hence,
the set I of all proper ideals of 9 is nonempty. If
9 ~ ¸?    0¹
is a chain of proper ideals in 9 , then the union @ ~ 0 ? is also an ideal.
Furthermore, if @ ~ 9 is not proper, then   @ and so   ? , for some   0 ,
which implies that ? ~ 9 is not proper. Hence, @  I . Thus, any chain in I
has an upper bound in I and so Zorn's lemma implies that I has a maximal
element. This shows that 9 has a maximal ideal.

Integral Domains
Definition Let 9 be a ring. A nonzero element r  9 is called a zero divisor if
there exists a nonzero  9 for which  ~ . A commutative ring 9 with
identity is called an integral domain if it contains no zero divisors.
Example 0.14 If  is not a prime number, then the ring { has zero divisors and
so is not an integral domain. To see this, observe that if  is not prime, then
 ~  in {, where Á   . But in { , we have

24

Advanced Linear Algebra

 p  ~  mod  ~ 
and so  and  are both zero divisors. As we will see later, if  is a prime, then
{ is a field (which is an integral domain, of course).
Example 0.15 The ring - ´%µ is an integral domain, since ²%³²%³ ~  implies
that ²%³ ~  or ²%³ ~ .
If 9 is a ring and % ~ & where Á %Á &  9 , then we cannot in general cancel
the 's and conclude that % ~ &. For instance, in { , we have  h  ~  h , but
canceling the 's gives  ~ . However, it is precisely the integral domains in
which we can cancel. The simple proof is left to the reader.
Theorem 0.24 Let 9 be a commutative ring with identity. Then 9 is an integral
domain if and only if the cancellation law
% ~ &Á  £  ¬ % ~ &
holds.

The Field of Quotients of an Integral Domain
Any integral domain 9 can be embedded in a field. The quotient field (or field
of quotients) of 9 is a field that is constructed from 9 just as the field of
rational numbers is constructed from the ring of integers. In particular, we set
9 b ~ ¸²Á ³  Á   9Á  £ ¹
where ²Á ³ ~ ²Z Á  Z ³ if and only if  Z ~ Z  . Addition and multiplication of
fractions is defined by
²Á ³ b ²Á ³ ~ ² b Á  ³
and
²Á ³ h ²Á ³ ~ ²Á  ³
It is customary to write ²Á ³ in the form ° . Note that if 9 has zero divisors,
then these definitions do not make sense, because  may be  even if  and
are not. This is why we require that 9 be an integral domain.

Principal Ideal Domains
Definition Let 9 be a ring with identity and let   9 . The principal ideal
generated by  is the ideal
º» ~ ¸    9¹
An integral domain 9 in which every ideal is a principal ideal is called a
principal ideal domain.

Theorem 0.25 The integers form a principal ideal domain. In fact, any ideal ?
in { is generated by the smallest positive integer a that is contained in ? .
Theorem 0.26 The ring - ´%µ is a principal ideal domain. In fact, any ideal ? is
generated by the unique monic polynomial of smallest degree contained in ? .
Moreover, for polynomials  ²%³Á Ã Á  ²%³,
º ²%³Á Ã Á  ²%³» ~ ºgcd¸ ²%³Á Ã Á  ²%³¹»
Proof. Let ? be an ideal in - ´%µ and let ²%³ be a monic polynomial of
smallest degree in ? . First, we observe that there is only one such polynomial in
? . For if ²%³  ? is monic and deg²²%³³ ~ deg²²%³³, then
²%³ ~ ²%³ c ²%³  ?
and since deg²²%³³  deg²²%³³, we must have ²%³ ~  and so
²%³ ~ ²%³.
We show that ? ~ º²%³». Since ²%³  ? , we have º²%³»  ? . To establish
the reverse inclusion, if ²%³  ? , then dividing ²%³ by ²%³ gives
²%³ ~ ²%³²%³ b ²%³
where ²%³ ~  or   deg ²%³  deg ²%³. But since ? is an ideal,
²%³ ~ ²%³ c ²%³²%³  ?
and so   deg ²%³  deg ²%³ is impossible. Hence, ²%³ ~  and
²%³ ~ ²%³²%³  º²%³»
This shows that ?  º²%³» and so ? ~ º²%³».
To prove the second statement, let ? ~ º ²%³Á Ã Á  ²%³». Then, by what we
have just shown,
? ~ º ²%³Á Ã Á  ²%³» ~ º²%³»
where ²%³ is the unique monic polynomial ²%³ in ? of smallest degree. In
particular, since  ²%³  º²%³», we have ²%³   ²%³ for each  ~ Á Ã Á .
In other words, ²%³ is a common divisor of the  ²%³'s.
Moreover, if ²%³   ²%³ for all , then  ²%³  º²%³» for all , which implies
that
²%³  º²%³» ~ º ²%³Á Ã Á  ²%³»  º²%³»
and so ²%³  ²%³. This shows that ²%³ is the greatest common divisor of the
 ²%³'s and completes the proof.

Example 0.16 The ring 9 ~ - ´%Á &µ of polynomials in two variables % and & is
not a principal ideal domain. To see this, observe that the set ? of all

principal ideal ? ~ º²%Á &³». Since %Á &  ? , there exist polynomials ²%Á &³
and ²%Á &³ for which
% ~ ²%Á &³²%Á &³ and & ~ ²%Á &³²%Á &³

(0.1)

But ²%Á &³ cannot be a constant, for then we would have ? ~ 9 . Hence,
deg²²%Á &³³   and so ²%Á &³ and ²%Á &³ must both be constants, which
implies that (0.1) cannot hold.
Theorem 0.27 Any principal ideal domain 9 satisfies the ascending chain
condition, that is, 9 cannot have a strictly increasing sequence of ideals
?  ?  Ä
where each ideal is properly contained in the next one.
Proof. Suppose to the contrary that there is such an increasing sequence of
ideals. Consider the ideal
< ~  ?
which must have the form < ~ º» for some   < . Since   ? for some  ,
we have ? ~ ? for all    , contradicting the fact that the inclusions are
proper.

Prime and Irreducible Elements
We can define the notion of a prime element in any integral domain. For
Á  9 , we say that  divides (written   ) if there exists an %  9 for
which ~ %.
Definition Let 9 be an integral domain.
1) An invertible element of 9 is called a unit. Thus, "  9 is a unit if "# ~ 
for some #  9 .
2) Two elements Á   9 are said to be associates if there exists a unit " for
which  ~ " . We denote this by writing    .
3) A nonzero nonunit   9 is said to be prime if
   ¬    or   
4) A nonzero nonunit   9 is said to be irreducible if
 ~  ¬  or  is a unit
Note that if  is prime or irreducible, then so is " for any unit ".
The property of being associate is clearly an equivalence relation.

2)   if and only if º» ~ º ».
3)  divides if and only if º »  º».
4)  properly divides , that is, ~ % where % is not a unit, if and only if
º »  º».
In the case of the integers, an integer is prime if and only if it is irreducible. In
any integral domain, prime elements are irreducible, but the converse need not
hold. (In the ring {´jc µ ~ ¸ b  jc  Á   {¹ the irreducible element 
divides the product ² b jc ³² c jc ³ ~ but does not divide either
factor.)
However, in principal ideal domains, the two concepts are equivalent.
Theorem 0.29 Let 9 be a principal ideal domain.
1) An   9 is irreducible if and only if the ideal º» is maximal.
2) An element in 9 is prime if and only if it is irreducible.
3) The elements Á   9 are relatively prime, that is, have no common
nonunit factors, if and only if there exist Á  9 for which
 b  ~ 
This is denoted by writing ²Á ³ ~ .
Proof. To prove 1), suppose that  is irreducible and that º»  º»  9 . Then
  º» and so  ~ % for some %  9. The irreducibility of  implies that  or
% is a unit. If  is a unit, then º» ~ 9 and if % is a unit, then º» ~ º%» ~ º».
This shows that º» is maximal. (We have º» £ 9 , since  is not a unit.)
Conversely, suppose that  is not irreducible, that is,  ~  where neither  nor
 is a unit. Then º»  º»  9 . But if º» ~ º», then   , which implies that
 is a unit. Hence º» £ º». Also, if º» ~ 9 , then  must be a unit. So we
conclude that º» is not maximal, as desired.
To prove 2), assume first that  is prime and  ~  . Then    or    . We
may assume that   . Therefore,  ~ % ~ % . Canceling 's gives  ~ %
and so  is a unit. Hence,  is irreducible. (Note that this argument applies in
any integral domain.)
Conversely, suppose that  is irreducible and let    . We wish to prove that
   or    . The ideal º» is maximal and so ºÁ » ~ º» or ºÁ » ~ 9 . In the
former case,    and we are done. In the latter case, we have
 ~ % b &

28

for some %Á &  9 . Thus,
 ~ % b &
and since  divides both terms on the right, we have    .
To prove 3), it is clear that if  b  ~ , then  and  are relatively prime. For
the converse, consider the ideal ºÁ », which must be principal, say
ºÁ » ~ º%». Then %   and %   and so % must be a unit, which implies that
ºÁ » ~ 9 . Hence, there exist Á  9 for which  b  ~ .

Unique Factorization Domains
Definition An integral domain 9 is said to be a unique factorization domain
if it has the following factorization properties:
1) Every nonzero nonunit element   9 can be written as a product of a finite
number of irreducible elements  ~  Ä .
2) The factorization into irreducible elements is unique in the sense that if
 ~  Ä and  ~  Ä are two such factorizations, then  ~  and
after a suitable reindexing of the factors,    .
Unique factorization is clearly a desirable property. Fortunately, principal ideal
domains have this property.
Theorem 0.30 Every principal ideal domain 9 is a unique factorization
domain.
Proof. Let   9 be a nonzero nonunit. If  is irreducible, then we are done. If
not, then  ~   , where neither factor is a unit. If  and  are irreducible, we
are done. If not, suppose that  is not irreducible. Then  ~   , where
neither  nor  is a unit. Continuing in this way, we obtain a factorization of
the form (after renumbering if necessary)
 ~   ~  ²  ³ ~ ²  ³²  ³ ~ ²   ³²  ³ ~ Ä
Each step is a factorization of  into a product of nonunits. However, this
process must stop after a finite number of steps, for otherwise it will produce an
infinite sequence  Á  Á Ã of nonunits of 9 for which b properly divides  .
But this gives the ascending chain of ideals
º »  º »  º »  º »  Ä
where the inclusions are proper. But this contradicts the fact that a principal
ideal domain satisfies the ascending chain condition. Thus, we conclude that
every nonzero nonunit has a factorization into irreducible elements.
As to uniqueness, if  ~  Ä and  ~  Ä are two such factorizations,
then because 9 is an integral domain, we may equate them and cancel like
factors, so let us assume this has been done. Thus,  £  for all Á  . If there are
no factors on either side, we are done. If exactly one side has no factors left,

then we have expressed  as a product of irreducible elements, which is not
possible since irreducible elements are nonunits.
Suppose that both sides have factors left, that is,
 Ä ~  Ä
where  £  . Then    Ä , which implies that    for some . We can
assume by reindexing if necessary that  ~   . Since  is irreducible 
must be a unit. Replacing  by   and canceling  gives
  Äc ~  Äc
This process can be repeated until we run out of 's or 's. If we run out of 's
first, then we have an equation of the form " Ä ~  where " is a unit,
which is not possible since the  's are not units. By the same reasoning, we
cannot run out of  's first and so  ~  and the 's and  's can be paired off as
associates.

Fields
For the record, let us give the definition of a field (a concept that we have been
using).
Definition A field is a set - , containing at least two elements, together with two
binary operations, called addition (denoted by b ) and multiplication
(denoted by juxtaposition), for which the following hold:
1) - is an abelian group under addition.
2) The set - i of all nonzero elements in - is an abelian group under
multiplication.
3) (Distributivity) For all Á Á   - ,
² b ³ ~  b  and ² b ³ ~  b 
We require that - have at least two elements to avoid the pathological case in
which  ~ .
Example 0.17 The sets r, s and d, of all rational, real and complex numbers,
respectively, are fields, under the usual operations of addition and multiplication
of numbers.
Example 0.18 The ring { is a field if and only if  is a prime number. We
have already seen that { is not a field if  is not prime, since a field is also an
integral domain. Now suppose that  ~  is a prime.
We have seen that { is an integral domain and so it remains to show that every
nonzero element in { has a multiplicative inverse. Let  £   { . Since
  , we know that  and  are relatively prime. It follows that there exist
integers " and # for which

30

Advanced Linear Algebra

" b # ~ 
Hence,
"  ² c #³   mod 
and so " p  ~  in { , that is, " is the multiplicative inverse of .
The previous example shows that not all fields are infinite sets. In fact, finite
fields play an extremely important role in many areas of abstract and applied
mathematics.
A field - is said to be algebraically closed if every nonconstant polynomial
over - has a root in - . This is equivalent to saying that every nonconstant
polynomial splits over - . For example, the complex field d is algebraically
closed but the real field s is not. We mention without proof that every field - is
contained in an algebraically closed field - , called the algebraic closure of - .
For example, the algebraic closure of the real field is the complex field.

The Characteristic of a Ring
Let 9 be a ring with identity. If  is a positive integer, then by  h , we simply
mean
h~ bÄ
b

 terms
Now, it may happen that there is a positive integer  for which
h~
For instance, in { , we have  h  ~  ~ . On the other hand, in {, the
equation  h  ~  implies  ~  and so no such positive integer exists.
Notice that in any finite ring, there must exist such a positive integer , since the
members of the infinite sequence of numbers
 h Á  h Á  h Á Ã
cannot be distinct and so  h  ~  h  for some    , whence ² c ³ h  ~ .
Definition Let 9 be a ring with identity. The smallest positive integer  for
which  h  ~  is called the characteristic of 9 . If no such number  exists, we
say that 9 has characteristic . The characteristic of 9 is denoted by
char²9³.
If char²9³ ~  , then for any   9 , we have

Theorem 0.31 Any finite ring has nonzero characteristic. Any finite integral
domain has prime characteristic.
Proof. We have already seen that a finite ring has nonzero characteristic. Let be a finite integral domain and suppose that char²- ³ ~   . If  ~  , where
Á    , then  h  ~ . Hence, ² h ³² h ³ ~ , implying that  h  ~  or
 h  ~ . In either case, we have a contradiction to the fact that  is the smallest
positive integer such that  h  ~ . Hence,  must be prime.
Notice that in any field - of characteristic , we have  ~  for all   - .
Thus, in - ,
 ~ c for all   This property takes a bit of getting used to and makes fields of characteristic 
quite exceptional. (As it happens, there are many important uses for fields of
characteristic .) It can be shown that all finite fields have size equal to a
positive integral power  of a prime  and for each prime power  , there is a
finite field of size  . In fact, up to isomorphism, there is exactly one finite field
of size  .

Algebras
The final algebraic structure of which we will have use is a combination of a
vector space and a ring. (We have not yet officially defined vector spaces, but
we will do so before needing the following definition, which is placed here for
easy reference.)
Definition An algebra 7 over a field - is a nonempty set 7, together with
three operations, called addition (denoted by b ), multiplication (denoted by
juxtaposition) and scalar multiplication (also denoted by juxtaposition), for
which the following properties hold:
1) 7 is a vector space over - under addition and scalar multiplication.
2) 7 is a ring under addition and multiplication.
3) If   - and Á   7, then
²³ ~ ²³ ~ ²³
Thus, an algebra is a vector space in which we can take the product of vectors,
or a ring in which we can multiply each element by a scalar (subject, of course,
to additional requirements as given in the definition).

Vector Spaces
Let us begin with the definition of one of our principal objects of study.
Definition Let - be a field, whose elements are referred to as scalars. A vector
space over - is a nonempty set = , whose elements are referred to as vectors,
together with two operations. The first operation, called addition and denoted
by b , assigns to each pair ²"Á #³ of vectors in = a vector " b # in = . The
second operation, called scalar multiplication and denoted by juxtaposition,
assigns to each pair ²Á "³  - d = a vector " in = . Furthermore, the
following properties must be satisfied:
1) (Associativity of addition) For all vectors "Á #Á $  = ,
" b ²# b $³ ~ ²" b #³ b $
2) (Commutativity of addition) For all vectors "Á #  = ,
"b#~#b"
3) (Existence of a zero) There is a vector   = with the property that
b"~"b~"
for all vectors "  = .
4) (Existence of additive inverses) For each vector "  = , there is a vector
in = , denoted by c", with the property that
" b ²c"³ ~ ²c"³ b " ~ 
