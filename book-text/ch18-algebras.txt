Note that 3) can be stated as follows: The product of two consecutive elements
Á Á  is the next element (with wraparound). Also, 4) says that &% ~ c%& for

We leave it to the reader to verify that i is a division algebra, called Hamilton's
quaternions, after their discoverer William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865).

Finite-Dimensional Division Algebras over an Algebraically Closed
Field
It happens that there are no interesting finite-dimensional division algebras over
an algebraically closed field.
Theorem 18.10 If + is a finite-dimensional division algebra over an
algebraically closed field - then + ~ - .
Proof. Let   + have minimal polynomial  ²%³. Since a division algebra has
no zero divisors,  ²%³ must be irreducible over - and so must be linear.
Hence,  ²%³ ~ % c  and so  ~   - .

Finite-Dimensional Division Algebras over a Finite Field
The finite-dimensional division algebras over a finite field are also easily
described: they are all commutative and so are finite fields. The proof, however,
is a bit more challenging. To understand the proof, we need two facts: the class
equation and some information about the complex roots of unity. So let us
briefly describe what we need.
The Class Equation
Those who have studied group theory have no doubt encountered the famous
class equation. Let . be a finite group. Each   . can be thought of as a
permutation  of . defined by
 % ~ %c
for all %  .. The set of all conjugates %c of % is denoted by ¸%¹. and so
¸%¹. ~ ¸ %    .¹
This set is also called a conjugacy class in . . Now, the following are
equivalent:

 % ~  %
%c ~ % c
 c % c ~ %
 c   *. ²%³
where
*. ²%³ ~ ¸  .  % ~ %¹
is the centralizer of %. But  c   *. ²%³ if and only if  and  are in the same
coset of *. ²%³. Thus, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the
conjugates of % and the cosets of *. ²%³. Hence,
b¸%¹. b ~ ². ¢ *. ²%³³
Since the distinct conjugacy classes form a partition of . (because conjugacy is
an equivalence relation), we have
(.( ~ b¸%¹. b ~ ². ¢ *. ²%³³
%:

%:

where : is a set consisting of exactly one element from each conjugacy class
¸%¹. . Note that a conjugacy class ¸%¹. has size  if and only if %c ~ % for
all   ., that is, % ~ % for all   . and these are precisely the elements in
the center A².³ of .. Hence, the previous equation can be written in the form
(.( ~ (A².³( b  ². ¢ *. ²%³³
%: Z

where : Z is a set consisting of exactly one element from each conjugacy class
¸%¹. of size greater than . This is the class equation for . .
The Complex Roots of Unity
If  is a positive integer, then the complex th roots of unity are the complex
solutions to the equation
% c  ~ 
The set < of complex th roots of unity is a cyclic group of order . To see
this, note first that < is an abelian group since Á   < implies that   <
and c  < . Also, since % c  has no multiple roots, < has order .
Now, in any finite abelian group ., if  is the maximum order of all elements
of ., then  ~  for all   .. Thus, if no element of < has order , then
   and every   . satisfies the equation % c  ~ , which has fewer
than  solutions. This contradiction implies that some element of < must have
order  and so < is cyclic.

An Introduction to Algebras

465

The elements of < that generate < , that is, the elements of order  are called
the primitive th roots of unity. We denote the set of primitive th roots of
unity by + . Hence, if   + , then
+ ~ ¸  ²Á ³ ~ ¹
has size ²³, where  is the Euler phi function. (The value ²³ is defined to
be the number of positive integers less than or equal to  and relatively prime to
.)
The th cyclotomic polynomial is defined by
8 ²%³ ~  ²% c $³
$+

Thus,
deg²8 ²%³³ ~ ²³
Since every th root of unity is a primitive  th root of unity for some    and
since every primitive  th root of unity for    is also an th root of unity, we
deduce that
< ~  +


where the union is a disjoint one. It follows that
% c  ~ 8 ²%³


Finally, we show that 8 ²%³ is monic and has integer coefficients by induction
on . It is clear from the definition that 8 ²%³ is monic. Since 8 ²%³ ~ % c ,
the result is true for  ~ . If  is a prime, then all nonidentity th roots of unity
are primitive and so
8 ²%³ ~

% c 
~ %c b %c2 b Ä b % b 
%c

and the result holds for  ~ . Assume the result holds for all proper divisors of
. Then
% c  ~ 8 ²%³8 ²%³ ~ 8 ²%³9²%³



By the induction hypothesis, 9²%³ has integer coefficients and it follows that
8 ²%³ must also have integer coefficients.
Wedderburn's Theorem
Now we can prove Wedderburn's theorem.

466

Advanced Linear Algebra

Theorem 18.11 (Wedderburn's theorem) If + is a finite division algebra, then
+ is a field.
Proof. We must show that + is commutative. Let . ~ +i be the multiplicative
group of all nonzero elements of +. The class equation is
(+i ( ~ (A²+i ³( b ²+i ¢ *² ³³
where the sum is taken over one representative  from each conjugacy class of
size greater than . If we assume for the purposes of contradiction that + is not
commutative, that is, that A²+i ³ £ +i , then the sum on the far right is not an
empty sum and so (* i ² ³(  (+i ( for some   +i .
The sets A²+³ and *² ³ are subalgebras of + and, in fact, A²+³ is a
commutative division algebra; that is, a field. Let (A²+³( ~ '  . Since
A²+³  *² ³, we may view *² ³ and + as vector spaces over A²+³ and so
(*² ³( ~ ' ² ³

and

(+( ~ ' 

for integers   ² ³  . The class equation now gives
' c 
' ² ³ c 
² ³

' c  ~ ' c  b 

and since ' ² ³ c   '  c , it follows that ² ³  .
If 8 ²%³ is the th cyclotomic polynomial, then 8 ²'³ divides '  c . But
8 ²'³ also divides each summand on the far right above, since its roots are not
roots of ' ² ³ c . It follows that 8 ²'³  ' c . On the other hand,
8 ²'³ ~  ²' c ³
+

and since  + implies that (' c (  ' c , we have a contradiction. Hence
A²+i ³ ~ +i and + is commutative, that is, + is a field.

Finite-Dimensional Real Division Algebras
We now consider the finite-dimensional division algebras over the real field s.
In 1877, Frobenius proved that there are only three such division algebras.
Theorem 18.12 (Frobenius, 1877) If + is a finite-dimensional division algbera
over s, then
+ ~ sÁ

+~d

or + ~ i

Proof. Note first that the minimal polynomial  ²%³ of any   + is either
linear, in which case   s or irreducible quadratic  ²%³ ~ % b % b with
 c   . Completing the square gives

Hence, any   + has the form

 ~ 6 b 7 c  ~  b !


where !  s and either  ~  or   . Hence,   s but  ¤ s. Thus, every
element of + is the sum of an element of s and an element of the set
+Z ~ ¸  +    ¹
that is, as sets:
+ ~ s b +Z
Also, s q +Z ~ ¸¹. To see that +Z is a subspace of +, let "Á #  +Z . We wish
to show that " b #  +Z . If # ~ " for some   s, then
" b # ~ ² b ³"  +Z . So assume that " and # are linearly independent. Then
" and # are nonzero and so also nonreal.
Now, " b # and " c # cannot both be real, since then " and # would be real. We
have seen that
"b#~b
and
"c#~ b
where Á  s, at least one of  or  is nonzero and  Á    . Then
²" b #³ b ²" c #³ ~ ² b ³ b ² b  ³
and so
" b # ~  b  b  b  b   b  
Collecting the real part on one side gives
 b   ~ " b # c ² b  b  b   ³
Now, if we knew that Á  and  were linearly independent over s we could
conclude that  ~ ~  and so
²" b #³ ~   

and

²" c #³ ~    

which shows that " b # and " c # are in +Z .
To see that ¸Á  Á ¹ is linearly independent, it is equivalent to show that
¸"Á #Á ¹ is linearly independent. But if

468

Advanced Linear Algebra

# ~ " b 
for Á   s, then
# ~  " b " b  
and since " ¤ s, it follows that  ~  and so  ~  or  ~ . But  £  since
# ¤ s and  £  since ¸"Á #¹ are linearly independent.
Thus, +Z is a subspace of + and
+ ~ s l +Z
We now look at +Z , which is a real vector space. If +Z ~ ¸¹, then + ~ s and
we are done, so assume otherwise. If   +Z is nonzero, then  ~ c where
  s. Hence,  ~ c  +Z satisfies  ~ c. If
+Z ~ s ~ ¸    s¹
then + ~ s l s ~ d and we are done. If not, then s is a proper subspace of
+Z .
In the quaternion field, there is an element  for which  b  ~ . So we seek a
  +Z ± s with this property. To this end, define a bilinear form on +Z by
º"Á #» ~ c²"# b #"³
Then it is easy to see that this form is a real inner product on +Z (positive
definite, symmetric and bilinear). Hence, if s is a proper subspace of +Z , then
+ Z ~ s p :
where p denotes the orthogonal direct sum. If "  : is nonzero, then
" ~ c for   s and so if  ~ "c , then
 ~ c

and

 b  ~ 

Now, s is a subspace of : and so
+ Z ~ s  p s p ;
Setting  ~ , we have
cºÁ » ~  b  ~  b  ~ 
and
cºÁ » ~  b  ~  b  ~ 
and so   ; and we can write
+Z ~ s p s p s p <

Now, if < £ ¸¹, then there is a "  < for which " ~ c and
" ~ c"
" ~ c"
" ~ c"
The third equation is "²³ ~ c²³" and so
"²³ ~ c²³" ~ " ~ c"
whence " ~ , which is false. Hence, < ~ ¸¹ and
+ ~ s l s l s l s ~ i
This completes the proof.

The Umbral Calculus

In this chapter, we give a brief introduction to an area called the umbral
calculus. This is a linear-algebraic theory used to study certain types of
polynomial functions that play an important role in applied mathematics. We
give only a brief introduction to the subject, emphasizing the algebraic aspects
rather than the applications. For more on the umbral calculus, may we suggest

The order ² ³ of  is the smallest exponent of ! that appears with a nonzero

If ² ³ ~ , then  has a compositional inverse, denoted by  and satisfying

The Umbral Algebra
Let F ~ d´%µ denote the algebra of polynomials in a single variable % over the
complex field. One of the starting points of the umbral calculus is the fact that
any formal power series in < can play three different roles: as a formal power
series, as a linear functional on F and as a linear operator on F . Let us first
explore the connection between formal power series and linear functionals.
Let F i denote the vector space of all linear functionals on F . Note that F i is the
algebraic dual space of F , as defined in Chapter 2. It will be convenient to
denote the action of 3  F i on ²%³  F by
º3  ²%³»
(This is the “bra-ket” notation of Paul Dirac.) The vector space operations on F i
then take the form
º3 b 4  ²%³» ~ º3  ²%³» b º4  ²%³»
and
º3  ²%³» ~ º3  ²%³»Á   d
Note also that since any linear functional on F is uniquely determined by its
values on a basis for F Á the functional 3  F i is uniquely determined by the
values º3  % » for   .
Now, any formal series in < can be written in the form
B

 
!
!
~

 ²!³ ~ 

and we can use this to define a linear functional  ²!³ by setting
º ²!³  % » ~ 
for   . In other words, the linear functional  ²!³ is defined by
B

º ²!³  % » 

~

 ²!³ ~ 

where the expression  ²!³ on the left is just a formal power series. Note in
particular that
º!  % » ~ !Á
where Á is the Kronecker delta function. This implies that
º!  ²%³» ~ ²³ ²³
and so ! is the functional “ th derivative at .” Also, ! is evaluation at .

474

Advanced Linear Algebra

As it happens, any linear functional 3 on F has the form  ²!³. To see this, we
simply note that if
B

3 ²!³ ~ 
then

º3 ²!³  % » ~ º3  % »
for all    and so as linear functionals, 3 ~ 3 ²!³.
Thus, we can define a map ¢ F i ¦ < by ²3³ ~ 3 ²!³.
Theorem 19.1 The map ¢ F i ¦ < defined by ²3³ ~ 3 ²!³ is a vector space
isomorphism from F i onto < .
Proof. To see that  is injective, note that
3 ²!³ ~ 4 ²!³ ¬ º3  % » ~ º4  % » for all    ¬ 3 ~ 4
Moreover, the map  is surjective, since for any   < , the linear functional
3 ~  ²!³ has the property that ²3³ ~ 3 ²!³ ~  ²!³. Finally,

From now on, we shall identify the vector space F i with the vector space < ,
using the isomorphism ¢ F i ¦ < . Thus, we think of linear functionals on F
simply as formal power series. The advantage of this approach is that < is more
than just a vector space—it is an algebra. Hence, we have automatically defined
a multiplication of linear functionals, namely, the product of formal power
series. The algebra < , when thought of as both the algebra of formal power
series and the algebra of linear functionals on F , is called the umbral algebra.
Let us consider an example.
Example 19.1 For   d, the evaluation functional   F i is defined by
º  ²%³» ~ ²³

! ! ~ ²b³!
and so the product of evaluation at  and evaluation at  is evaluation at

When we are thinking of a delta series   < as a linear functional, we refer to
it as a delta functional. Similarly, an invertible series   < is referred to as an

Let us consider a few examples of important linear functionals and their power

2) The forward difference functional is the delta functional ! c ,

3) The Abel functional is the delta functional !e! , satisfying

The inverse !°²! c ³ of this functional is associated with the Bernoulli

Formal Power Series as Linear Operators
We now turn to the connection between formal power series and linear
operators on F . Let us denote the  th derivative operator on F by ! . Thus,

We can then extend this to formal series in !,

With this definition, we see that each formal power series   < plays three
roles in the umbral calculus, namely, as a formal power series, as a linear
functional and as a linear operator. The two notations º ²!³  ²%³» and
 ²!³²%³ will make it clear whether we are thinking of  as a functional or as an
operator.
It is important to note that  ~  in < if and only if  ~  as linear functionals,
which holds if and only if  ~  as linear operators. It is also worth noting that
´ ²!³²!³µ²%³ ~  ²!³´²!³²%³µ
and so we may write  ²!³²!³²%³ without ambiguity. In addition,
 ²!³²!³²%³ ~ ²!³ ²!³²%³
for all  Á   < and   F .
When we are thinking of a delta series  as an operator, we call it a delta
operator. The following theorem describes the key relationship between linear
functionals and linear operators of the form  ²!³.
Theorem 19.4 If  Á   < , then
º ²!³²!³  ²%³» ~ º ²!³  ²!³²%³»
for all polynomials ²%³  F .
Proof. If  has the form (19.2), then by (19.3),

By linearity, this holds for % replaced by any polynomial ²%³. Hence,
applying this to the product   gives
º ²!³²!³  ²%³» ~ º!   ²!³²!³²%³»
~ º!   ²!³´²!³²%³µ» ~ º ²!³  ²!³²%³»
Equation (19.4) shows that applying the linear functional  (!³ is equivalent to
applying the operator  ²!³ and then following by evaluation at % ~ .

Here are the operator versions of the functionals in Example 19.2.

We have seen that all linear functionals on F have the form  ²!³, for   < .
However, not all linear operators on F have this form. To see this, observe that
deg ´ ²!³²%³µ  deg ²%³
but the linear operator ¢ F ¦ F defined by ²²%³³ ~ %²%³ does not have
this property.
Let us characterize the linear operators of the form  ²!³. First, we need a lemma.
Lemma 19.5 If ; is a linear operator on 7 and ;  ²!³ ~  ²!³; for some delta
series  ²!³, then deg²; ²%³³  deg²²%³³.
Proof. For any   ,
deg²; % ³ c  ~ deg² ²!³; % ³ ~ deg²;  ²!³% ³
and so

deg²; % ³ ~ deg²;  ²!³% ³ b 
Since deg² ²!³% ³ ~  c  we have the basis for an induction. When  ~ 
we get deg²; ³ ~ . Assume that the result is true for  c . Then
deg²; % ³ ~ deg²;  ²!³% ³ b    c  b  ~ 
Theorem 19.6 The following are equivalent for a linear operator ; ¢ F ¦ F .
1) ; has the form  ²!³, that is, there exists an   < for which ; ~  ²!³, as
linear operators.
2) ; commutes with the derivative operator, that is, ; ! ~ !; .
3) ; commutes with any delta operator ²!³, that is, ; ²!³ ~ ²!³; .
4) ; commutes with any translation operator, that is, ; ! ~ ! ; .
Proof. It is clear that 1) implies 2). For the converse, let

and since this holds for all  and  we get ; ~ ²!³. We leave the rest of the
proof as an exercise.

Sheffer Sequences
We can now define the principal object of study in the umbral calculus. When
referring to a sequence  ²%³ in F , we shall always assume that deg  ²%³ ~ 
for all   .
Theorem 19.7 Let  be a delta series, let  be an invertible series and consider
the geometric sequence

Definition The sequence  ²%³ in (19.5) is called the Sheffer sequence for the
ordered pair ²²!³Á  ²!³³. We shorten this by saying that  ²%³ is Sheffer for
²²!³Á  ²!³³.
Two special types of Sheffer sequences deserve explicit mention.
Definition The Sheffer sequence for a pair of the form ²Á  ²!³³ is called the
associated sequence for  ²!³. The Sheffer sequence for a pair of the form
²²!³Á !³ is called the Appell sequence for ²!³.

482

Note that the sequence

 ²%³ is Sheffer for ²²!³Á  ²!³³ if and only if

º²!³  ²!³ 

 ²%³» ~ [Á

which is equivalent to
º  ²!³  ²!³  ²%³» ~ [Á
which, in turn, is equivalent to saying that the sequence  ²%³ ~ ²!³  ²%³ is
the associated sequence for  ²!³.
Theorem 19.8 The sequence  ²%³ is Sheffer for ²²!³Á  ²!³³ if and only if the
sequence  ²%³ ~ ²!³  ²%³ is the associated sequence for  ²!³.
Before considering examples, we wish to describe several characterizations of
Sheffer sequences. First, we require a key result.
Theorem 19.9 (The expansion theorems) Let
1) For any   < ,

 ²%³ be Sheffer for ²²!³Á  ²!³³.

Part 2) follows in a similar way from Theorem 19.2.
We can now begin our characterization of Sheffer sequences, starting with the
generating function. The idea of a generating function is quite simple. If  ²%³ is
a sequence of polynomials, we may define a formal power series of the form
B

 ²%³ 
!
!

²!Á %³ ~ 

This is referred to as the (exponential) generating function for the sequence
 ²%³. (The term exponential refers to the presence of  ! in this series. When
this is not present, we have an ordinary generating function.³ Since the series is
a formal one, knowing ²!Á %³ is equivalent (in theory, if not always in practice)
