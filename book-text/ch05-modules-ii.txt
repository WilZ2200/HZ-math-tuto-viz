similar result holds for free 9 -modules. We begin with the fact that ²9 ) ³ is a
free 9 -module. The simple proof is left to the reader.
Theorem 5.2 Let ) be any set and let 9 be a commutative ring with identity.
The set ²9 ) ³ of all functions from ) to 9 that have finite support is a free 9 module of rank () ( with basis 8 ~ ¸ ¹ where
 ²%³ ~ F

if % £ 

This basis is referred to as the standard basis for ²9 ) ³ .
Theorem 5.3 Let 4 be an 9 -module. If ) is a basis for 4 , then 4 is
isomorphic to ²9 ) ³ .
Proof. Consider the map ¢ 4 ¦ ²9 ) ³ defined by setting
  ~ 
where  is defined in Theorem 5.2 and extending  to 4 by linearity. Since 
maps a basis for 4 to a basis 8 ~ ¸ ¹ for ²9 ) ³ , it follows that  is an
isomorphism from 4 to ²9 ) ³ .
Theorem 5.4 Two free 9 -modules (over a commutative ring) are isomorphic if
and only if they have the same rank.
Proof. If 4  5 , then any isomorphism  from 4 to 5 maps a basis for 4 to
a basis for 5 . Since  is a bijection, we have rk²4 ³ ~ rk²5 ³. Conversely,
suppose that rk²4 ³ ~ rk²5 ³. Let 8 be a basis for 4 and let 9 be a basis for 5 .
Since (8 ( ~ (9(, there is a bijective map  ¢ 8 ¦ 9 . This map can be extended by
linearity to an isomorphism of 4 onto 5 and so 4  5 .
We have seen that the cardinality of a (minimal) spanning set for a free module
4 is at least equal to rk²4 ³. Let us now speak about the cardinality of maximal
linearly independent sets.
Theorem 5.5 Let 9 be an integral domain and let 4 be a free 9 -module. Then
all linearly independent sets have cardinality at most rk²4 ³.
Proof. Since 4  ²9  ³ we need only prove the result for ²9  ³ . Let 8 be the
field of quotients of 9 . Then ²8 ³ is a vector space. Now, if
8 ~ ¸#    0¹  ²9  ³  ²8 ³
is linearly independent over 8 as a subset of ²8 ³ , then 8 is clearly linearly
independent over 9 as a subset of ²9  ³ . Conversely, suppose that 8 is linearly
independent over 9 and

where  £  for all  and  £  for some . Multiplying by

which implies that  ~  for all . Thus 8 is linearly dependent over 9 if and
only if it is linearly dependent over 8. But in the vector space ²8 ³ , all sets of
cardinality greater than  are linearly dependent over 8 and hence all subsets of
²9  ³ of cardinality greater than  are linearly dependent over 9 .

Free Modules and Epimorphisms
If ¢ 4 ¦ - is a module epimorphism where - is free on 8, then it is easy to
define a right inverse for  , since we can define an 9 -map 9 ¢ - ¦ 4 by
specifying its values arbitrarily on 8 and extending by linearity. Thus, we take
9 ²³ to be any member of c ²³. Then Theorem 4.16 implies that ker²³ is a
direct summand of 4 and
4  ker²³ ^ This discussion applies to the canonical projection ¢ 4 ¦ 4 °: provided that
the quotient 4 °: is free.
Theorem 5.6 Let 9 be a commutative ring with identity.
1) If ¢ 4 ¦ - is an 9 -epimorphism and - is free, then ker²³ is
complemented and
4 ~ ker²³ l 5  ker²³ ^ where 5  - .

Noetherian Modules
One of the most desirable properties of a finitely generated 9 -module 4 is that
all of its submodules be finitely generated:

Modules II: Free and Noetherian Modules

4 finitely generated, :  4

¬

133

: finitely generated

Example 4.2 shows that this is not always the case and leads us to search for
conditions on the ring 9 that will guarantee this property for 9 -modules.
Definition An 9 -module 4 is said to satisfy the ascending chain condition
(abbreviated ACC) on submodules if every ascending sequence of submodules
:  :  :  Ä
of 4 is eventually constant, that is, there exists an index  for which
: ~ :b ~ :kb ~ Ä
Modules with the ascending chain condition on submodules are also called
Noetherian modules (after Emmy Noether, one of the pioneers of module
theory).
Since a ring 9 is a module over itself and since the submodules of the module 9
are precisely the ideals of the ring 9 , the preceding definition can be formulated
for rings as follows.
Definition A ring 9 is said to satisfy the ascending chain condition
(abbreviated ACC) on ideals if any ascending sequence
?  ?   ?   Ä
of ideals of 9 is eventually constant, that is, there exists an index  for which
? ~ ?b ~ ?b2 ~ Ä
A ring that satisfies the ascending chain condition on ideals is called a
Noetherian ring.
The following theorem describes the relevance of this to the present discussion.
Theorem 5.7
1) An 9 -module 4 is Noetherian if and only if every submodule of 4 is
finitely generated.
2) In particular, a ring 9 is Noetherian if and only if every ideal of 9 is
finitely generated.
Proof. Suppose that all submodules of 4 are finitely generated and that 4
contains an infinite ascending sequence
:  :  :3  Ä
of submodules. Then the union

(5.1)

134

: ~  :

is easily seen to be a submodule of 4 . Hence, : is finitely generated, say
: ~ ºº" Á Ã Á " »». Since "  : , there exists an index  such that "  : .
Therefore, if  ~ max¸ Á Ã Á  ¹, we have
¸" Á Ã Á " ¹  :
and so
: ~ ºº" Á Ã Á " »»  :  :b  :b  Ä  :
which shows that the chain (5.1) is eventually constant.
For the converse, suppose that 4 satisfies the ACC on submodules and let : be
a submodule of 4 . Pick "  : and consider the submodule : ~ ºº" »»  :
generated by " . If : ~ : , then : is finitely generated. If : £ : , then there is
a "  : c : . Now let : ~ ºº" ," »». If : ~ : , then : is finitely generated.
If : £ : , then pick "3  : c : and consider the submodule
:3 ~ ºº" ," ,"3 »».
Continuing in this way, we get an ascending chain of submodules
ºº" »»  ºº" Á " »»  ºº" Á " Á " »»  Ä  :
If none of these submodules were equal to : , we would have an infinite
ascending chain of submodules, each properly contained in the next, which
contradicts the fact that 4 satisfies the ACC on submodules. Hence,
: ~ ºº" Á Ã Á " »» for some  and so : is finitely generated.
Our goal is to find conditions under which all finitely generated 9 -modules are
Noetherian. The very pleasing answer is that all finitely generated 9 -modules
are Noetherian if and only if 9 is Noetherian as an 9 -module, or equivalently,
as a ring.
Theorem 5.8 Let 9 be a commutative ring with identity.
1) 9 is Noetherian if and only if every finitely generated 9 -module is
Noetherian.
2) Let 9 be a principal ideal domain. If an 9 -module 4 is -generated, then
any submodule of 4 is also -generated.
Proof. For part 1), one direction is evident. Assume that 9 is Noetherian and
let 4 ~ ºº" Á Ã Á " »» be a finitely generated 9 -module. Consider the
epimorphism ¢ 9  ¦ 4 defined by
² Á Ã Á  ³ ~  " b Ä b  "
Let : be a submodule of 4 . Then

 c ²:³ ~ ¸"  9    "  :¹
is a submodule of 9  and  ² c :³ ~ : . If every submodule of 9  is finitely
generated, then  c ²:³ is finitely generated and so  c ²:³ ~ ºº# Á Ã Á # »».
Then : is finitely generated by ¸ # Á Ã Á  # ¹. Thus, it is sufficient to prove the
theorem for 9  , which we do by induction on .
If  ~ , any submodule of 9 is an ideal of 9 , which is finitely generated by
assumption. Assume that every submodule of 9  is finitely generated for all
     and let : be a submodule of 9  .
If   , we can extract from : something that is isomorphic to an ideal of 9
and so will be finitely generated. In particular, let : be the “last coordinates” in
:, specifically, let
: ~ ¸²Á Ã Á Á  ³  ² Á Ã Á c Á  ³  : for some  Á Ã Á c  9¹
The set : is isomorphic to an ideal of 9 and is therefore finitely generated, say
: ~ ºº= »», where = ~ ¸ Á Ã Á  ¹ is a finite subset of : .
Also, let
: ~ ¸#  :  # ~ ² Á Ã Á c Á ³ for some  Á Ã Á c  9¹
be the set of all elements of : that have last coordinate equal to . Note that :
is a submodule of 9  and is isomorphic to a submodule of 9 c . Hence, the
inductive hypothesis implies that : is finitely generated, say : ~ ºº= »», where
= is a finite subset of : .
By definition of : , each   = has the form
 ~ ²Á Ã Á Á Á ³
for Á  9 where there is a   : of the form
 ~ ²Á Á Ã Á Ác Á Á ³
Let =  ~ ¸ Á Ã Á  ¹. We claim that : is generated by the finite set =  r = .
To see this, let # ~ ² Á Ã Á  ³  : . Then ²Á Ã Á Á  ³  : and so

Hence
# ~ ²# c $³ b $  ºº=  »» b ºº= »» ~ ºº=  r = »»
as desired.
For part 2), we leave it to the reader to review the proof and make the necessary
changes. The key fact is that : is isomorphic to an ideal of 9 , which is
principal. Hence, : is generated by a single element of 4 .

The Hilbert Basis Theorem
Theorem 5.8 naturally leads us to ask which familiar rings are Noetherian. The
following famous theorem describes one very important case.
Theorem 5.9 (Hilbert basis theorem) If a ring 9 is Noetherian, then so is the
polynomial ring 9´%µ.
Proof. We wish to show that any ideal ? in 9´%µ is finitely generated. Let 3
denote the set of all leading coefficients of polynomials in ? , together with the 
element of 9 . Then 3 is an ideal of 9 .
To see this, observe that if   3 is the leading coefficient of  ²%³  ? and if
  9 , then either  ~  or else  is the leading coefficient of  ²%³  ? . In
either case,   3. Similarly, suppose that   3 is the leading coefficient of
²%³  ? . We may assume that deg  ²%³ ~  and deg ²%³ ~ , with   . Then
²%³ ~ %c  ²%³ is in ? , has leading coefficient  and has the same degree as
²%³. Hence, either  c  is  or  c  is the leading coefficient of
²%³ c ²%³  ? . In either case  c   3.
Since 3 is an ideal of the Noetherian ring 9 , it must be finitely generated, say
3 ~ º Á Ã Á  ». Since   3, there exist polynomials  ²%³  ? with leading
coefficient  . By multiplying each  ²%³ by a suitable power of %, we may
assume that
deg  ²%³ ~  ~ max¸deg  ²%³¹
for all  ~ Á Ã Á .

Now for  ~ Á Ã Á  c  let 3 be the set of all leading coefficients of
polynomials in ? of degree  , together with the  element of 9 . A similar
argument shows that 3 is an ideal of 9 and so 3 is also finitely generated.
Hence, we can find polynomials 7 ~ ¸Á ²%³Á Ã Á Á ²%³¹ in ? whose
leading coefficients constitute a generating set for 3 .
Consider now the finite set

If @ is the ideal generated by 7 , then @  ? . An induction argument can be

combination of the elements of 7 (which are constants) and is thus in @ .
Assume that any polynomial in ? of degree less than  is in @ and let ²%³  ?

If   , then some linear combination ²%³ over 9 of the polynomials in 7

combination ²%³ of the polynomials

²%³  @ that has the same leading coefficient as ²%³. Since ²%³ c ²%³  ?
has degree strictly smaller than that of ²%³ the induction hypothesis implies that
²%³ c ²%³  @

This completes the induction and shows that ? ~ @ is finitely generated.

Modules over a Principal Ideal Domain

We remind the reader of a few of the basic properties of principal ideal
domains.
Theorem 6.1 Let 9 be a principal ideal domain.
1) An element   9 is irreducible if and only if the ideal º» is maximal.
2) An element in 9 is prime if and only if it is irreducible.
3) 9 is a unique factorization domain.
4) 9 satisfies the ascending chain condition on ideals. Hence, so does any
finitely generated 9 -module 4 . Moreover, if 4 is -generated, then any
submodule of 4 is -generated.

Annihilators and Orders
When 9 is a principal ideal domain, all annihilators are generated by a single
element. This permits the following definition.
Definition Let 9 be a principal ideal domain and let 4 be an 9 -module.
1) If 5 is a submodule of 4 , then any generator of ann²5 ³ is called an order
of 5 .
2) An order of an element #  4 is an order of the submodule ºº#»».
For readers acquainted with group theory, we mention that the order of a
module corresponds to the smallest exponent of a group, not to the order of the
group.
Theorem 6.2 Let 9 be a principal ideal domain and let 4 be an 9 -module.
1) If  is an order of 5  4 , then the orders of 5 are precisely the
associates of . We denote any order of 5 by ²5 ³ and, as is customary,
refer to ²5 ³ as “the” order of 5 .
2) If 4 ~ ( l ) , then
²4 ³ ~ lcm²²(³Á ²)³³

140

Advanced Linear Algebra

that is, the orders of 4 are precisely the least common multiples of the
orders of ( and ) .
Proof. We leave proof of part 1) for the reader. For part 2), suppose that
²4 ³ ~  Á

²(³ ~ Á

²)³ ~  Á

 ~ lcm²Á  ³

Then  ( ~ ¸¹ and  ) ~ ¸¹ imply that    and    and so    . On the
other hand,  annihilates both ( and ) and therefore also 4 ~ ( l ) . Hence,
   and so    is an order of 4 .

Cyclic Modules
The simplest type of nonzero module is clearly a cyclic module. Despite their
simplicity, cyclic modules will play a very important role in our study of linear
operators on a finite-dimensional vector space and so we want to explore some
of their basic properties, including their composition and decomposition.
Theorem 6.3 Let 9 be a principal ideal domain.
1) If ºº#»» is a cyclic 9 -module with annihilator º», then the multiplication
map  ¢ 9 ¦ ºº#»» defined by   ~ # is an 9 -epimorphism with kernel º».
Hence the induced map
¢

9
¦ ºº#»»
º »

defined by
² b º»³ ~ #
is an isomorphism. In other words, cyclic 9 -modules are isomorphic to
quotient modules of the base ring 9 .
2) Any submodule of a cyclic 9 -module is cyclic.
3) If ºº#»» is a cyclic submodule of 4 of order , then for   9 ,

²ºº #»»³ ~
gcd² Á ³
Also,
ºº #»» ~ ºº#»»

¯

²²#³Á  ³ ~ 

¯

²#³ ~ ²#³

Proof. We leave proof of part 1) as an exercise. For part 2), let :  ºº#»». Then
0 ~ ¸  9  #  :¹ is an ideal of 9 and so 0 ~ º » for some  9 . Thus,
: ~ 0# ~ 9 # ~ ºº #»»
For part 3), we have ² #³ ~  if and only if ² ³# ~ , that is, if and only if
   , which is equivalent to

The Decomposition of Cyclic Modules
The following theorem shows how cyclic modules can be composed and
decomposed.
Theorem 6.4 Let 4 be an 9 -module.
1) (Composing cyclic modules) If " Á Ã Á "  4 have relatively prime
orders, then
²" b Ä b " ³ ~ ²" ³Ä²" ³
and
ºº" »» l Ä l ºº" »» ~ ºº" b Ä b " »»
Consequently, if
4 ~ ( b Ä b (
where the submodules ( have relatively prime orders, then the sum is
direct.
2) (Decomposing cyclic modules) If ²#³ ~  Ä where the  's are
pairwise relatively prime, then # has the form
# ~ " b Ä b " 
where ²" ³ ~  and so
ºº#»» ~ ºº" b Ä b " »» ~ ºº" »» l Ä l ºº"»»
Proof. For part 1), let  ~ ²" ³,    Ä and #  " b Ä b " . Then
since  annihilates #, the order of # divides . If ²#³ is a proper divisor of ,
then for some index  , there is a prime    for which ° annihilates #. But
° annihilates each " for  £  . Thus,
