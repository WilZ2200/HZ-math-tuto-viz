Metric Vector Spaces: The Theory of Bilinear Forms

Proof. It is clear that orthogonality is symmetric if the form is symmetric or
alternate, since in the latter case, the form is also skew-symmetric.
For the converse, assume that orthogonality is symmetric. For convenience, let
%  & mean that º%Á &» ~ º&Á %» and let %  = mean that º%Á #» ~ º#Á %» for all
#  = . If %  = for all %  = , then = is orthogonal and we are done. So let us
\ =.
examine vectors % with the property that % 
We wish to show that

(11.1)

Note that if the second conclusion holds, then since %  %, it follows that % is

Now,
º%Á &»²º%Á '» c º'Á %»³ ~ º%Á &»º%Á '» c º%Á &»º'Á %»

But reversing the coordinates in the last expression gives
ºº&Á %»' c &º'Á %»Á %» ~ º&Á %»º'Á %» c º&Á %»º'Á %» ~ 
and so the symmetry of orthogonality implies that the last expression is  and so
we have proven (11.1).
Let us assume that = is not orthogonal and show that all vectors in = are
isotropic, whence = is symplectic. Since = is not orthogonal, there exist

Orthogonal and Symplectic Geometries
If a metric vector space is both orthogonal and symplectic, then the form is both
symmetric and skew-symmetric and so
º"Á #» ~ º#Á "» ~ cº"Á #»
Therefore, when char²- ³ £ , = is orthogonal and symplectic if and only if =
is totally degenerate.
However, if char²- ³ ~ , then there are orthogonal symplectic geometries that
are not totally degenerate. For example, let = ~ span²"Á #³ be a twodimensional vector space and define a form on = whose matrix is
4 ~>

Since 4 is both symmetric and alternate, so is the form.

Linear Functionals
The Riesz representation theorem says that every linear functional  on a finitedimensional real or complex inner product space = is represented by a Riesz
vector 9  = , in the sense that
 ²#³ ~ º#Á 9 »
for all #  = . A similar result holds for nonsingular metric vector spaces.
Let = be a metric vector space over - . Let %  = and define the inner product
map º h Á %»¢ = ¦ - by
º h Á %»# ~ º#Á %»
This is easily seen to be a linear functional and so we can define a linear map
¢ = ¦ = i by
% ~ º h Á %»
The bilinearity of the form ensures that  is linear and the kernel of  is
ker² ³ ~ ¸%  =  º= Á %» ~ ¸¹¹ ~ =  ~ rad²= ³
Hence,  is injective (and therefore an isomorphism) if and only if = is
nonsingular.
Theorem 11.5 (The Riesz representation theorem) Let = be a finitedimensional nonsingular metric vector space. The map ¢ = ¦ = i defined by

Metric Vector Spaces: The Theory of Bilinear Forms

269

% ~ º h Á %»
is an isomorphism from = to = i . It follows that for each   = i there exists a
unique vector %  = for which
 # ~ º#Á %»
for all #  = .
The requirement that = be nonsingular is necessary. As a simple example, if =
is totally singular, then no nonzero linear functional could possibly be
represented by an inner product.
The Riesz representation theorem applies to nonsingular metric vector spaces.
However, we can also achieve something useful for singular subspaces : of a
nonsingular metric vector space. The reason is that any linear functional   : i
can be extended to a linear functional  on = , where it has a Riesz vector, that
is,
 # ~ º#Á 9 » ~ º h Á 9 »#
Hence,  also has this form, where its “Riesz vector” is an element of = , but is
not necessarily in : .
Theorem 11.6 (The Riesz representation theorem for subspaces) Let : be a
subspace of a metric vector space = . If either = or : is nonsingular, the linear
map ¢ = ¦ : i defined by
% ~ º h Á %»O:
is surjective and has kernel :  . Hence, for any linear functional   : i , there
is a (not necessarily unique) vector %  = for which  ~ º Á %» for all  : .
Moreover, if : is nonsingular, then % can be taken from : , in which case it is
unique.

Orthogonal Complements and Orthogonal Direct Sums
Definition A metric vector space = is the orthogonal direct sum of the
subspaces : and ; , written
= ~: p;
if = ~ : l ; and :  ; .
If : is a subspace of a real inner product space, the projection theorem says that
the orthogonal complement :  of : is a true vector space complement of : ,
that is,
= ~ : p :

270

Advanced Linear Algebra

However, in general metric vector spaces, an orthogonal complement may not
be a vector space complement. In fact, Example 11.3 shows that in some cases
:  ~ : . In other cases, for example, if # is degenerate, then º#» ~ = .
However, as we will see, the orthogonal complement of : is a vector space
complement if and only if either the sum is correct, = ~ : b :  , or the
intersection is correct, : q :  ~ ¸¹. Note that the latter is equivalent to the
nonsingularity of : .
Many nice properties of orthogonality in real inner product spaces do carry over
to nonsingular metric vector spaces. Moreover, the next result shows that the
restriction to nonsingular spaces is not that severe.
Theorem 11.7 Let = be a metric vector space. Then
= ~ rad²= ³ p :
where : is nonsingular and rad²= ³ is totally singular.
Proof. If : is any vector space complement of rad²= ³, then rad²= ³  : and so
= ~ rad²= ³ p :
Also, : is nonsingular since rad²:³  rad²= ³.
Here are some properties of orthogonality in nonsingular metric vector spaces.
In particular, if either = or : is nonsingular, then the orthogonal complement of
: always has the expected dimension,
dim²:  ³ ~ dim²= ³ c dim²:³
even if :  is not well behaved with respect to its intersection with : .
Theorem 11.8 Let : be a subspace of a finite-dimensional metric vector space
=.
1) If either = or : is nonsingular, then
dim²:³ b dim²:  ³ ~ dim²= ³
Hence, the following are equivalent:
a) = ~ : b : 
b) : is nonsingular, that is, : q :  ~ ¸¹
c) = ~ : p :  .
2) If = is nonsingular, then
a) :  ~ :
b) rad²:³ ~ rad²:  ³
c) : is nonsingular if and only if :  is nonsingular.
Proof. For part 1), the map ¢ = ¦ : i of Theorem 11.6 is surjective and has
kernel :  . Thus, the rank-plus-nullity theorem implies that

Metric Vector Spaces: The Theory of Bilinear Forms

271

dim²: i ³ b dim²:  ³ ~ dim²= ³
However, dim²: i ³ ~ dim²:³ and so part 1) follows. For part 2), since
rad²:³ ~ : q :   :  q :  ~ rad²:  ³
the nonsingularity of :  implies the nonsingularity of : . Then part 1) implies
that
dim²:³ b dim²:  ³ ~ dim²= ³
and
dim²:  ³ b dim²:  ³ ~ dim²= ³
Hence, :  ~ : and rad²:³ ~ rad²:  ³.
The previous theorem cannot in general be strengthened. Consider the twodimensional metric vector space = ~ span²"Á #³ where
º"Á "» ~ Á º"Á #» ~ Á º#Á #» ~ 
If : ~ span²"³, then :  ~ span²#³. Now, : is nonsingular but :  is singular
and so 2c) does not hold. Also, rad²:³ ~ ¸¹ and rad²:  ³ ~ :  and so 2b)
fails. Finally, :  ~ = £ : and so 2a) fails.

Isometries
We now turn to a discussion of structure-preserving maps on metric vector
spaces.
Definition Let = and > be metric vector spaces. We use the same notation ºÁ »
for the bilinear form on each space. A bijective linear map ¢ = ¦ > is called
an isometry if
º "Á  #» ~ º"Á #»
for all vectors " and # in = . If an isometry exists from = to > , we say that =
and > are isometric and write =  > . It is evident that the set of all
isometries from = to = forms a group under composition.
If = is a nonsingular orthogonal geometry, an isometry of = is called an
orthogonal transformation. The set E²= ³ of all orthogonal transformations
on = is a group under composition, known as the orthogonal group of = .
If = is a nonsingular symplectic geometry, an isometry of = is called a
symplectic transformation. The set Sp²= ³ of all symplectic transformations on
= is a group under composition, known as the symplectic group of = .

272

Advanced Linear Algebra

Note that, in contrast to the case of real inner product spaces, we must include
the requirement that  be bijective since this does not follow automatically if =
is singular. Here are a few of the basic properties of isometries.
Theorem 11.9 Let   B²= Á > ³ be a linear transformation between finitedimensional metric vector spaces = and > .
1) Let 8 ~ ¸# Á Ã Á # ¹ be a basis for = . Then  is an isometry if and only if 
is bijective and
º # Á  # » ~ º# Á # »
for all Á .
2) If = is orthogonal and char²- ³ £ , then  is an isometry if and only if it is
bijective and
º #Á  #» ~ º#Á #»
for all #  = .
3) Suppose that ¢ =  > is an isometry and
= ~ : p :

and

> ~ ; p ;

If  : ~ ; , then  ²:  ³ ~ ;  .
Proof. We prove part 3) only. To see that ²:  ³ ~ ;  , if '  :  and !  ; ,
then since ; ~  : , we can write ! ~  for some  : and so
º 'Á !» ~ º 'Á  » ~ º'Á » ~ 
whence ²:  ³  ;  . But since the dimensions are equal, it follows that
²:  ³ ~ ;  .

Hyperbolic Spaces
A special type of two-dimensional metric vector space plays an important role in
the structure theory of metric vector spaces.
Definition Let = be a metric vector space. A hyperbolic pair is a pair of
vectors "Á #  = for which
º"Á "» ~ º#Á #» ~ Á º"Á #» ~ 
Note that º#Á "» ~  if = is orthogonal and º#Á "» ~ c if = is symplectic. In
either case, the subspace / ~ span²"Á #³ is called a hyperbolic plane and any
space of the form
> ~ / p Ä p / 
where each / is a hyperbolic plane, is called a hyperbolic space. If ²" Á # ³ is
a hyperbolic pair for / , then we refer to the basis
²" Á # Á Ã Á " Á # ³

Metric Vector Spaces: The Theory of Bilinear Forms

273

for > as a hyperbolic basis. (In the symplectic case, the usual term is
symplectic basis.)
Note that any hyperbolic space > is nonsingular.
In the orthogonal case, hyperbolic planes can be characterized by their degree of
isotropy, so to speak. (In the symplectic case, all spaces are totally isotropic by
definition.) Indeed, we leave it as an exercise to prove that a two-dimensional
nonsingular orthogonal geometry = is a hyperbolic plane if and only if =
contains exactly two one-dimensional totally isotropic (equivalently, totally
degenerate) subspaces. Put another way, the cone of isotropic vectors is the
union of two one-dimensional subspaces of = .

Nonsingular Completions of a Subspace
Let < be a subspace of a nonsingular metric vector space = . If < is singular, it
is of interest to find a minimal nonsingular subspace of = containing < .
Definition Let = be a nonsingular metric vector space and let < be a subspace
of = . A subspace : of = for which <  : is called an extension of < . A
nonsingular completion of < is an extension of < that is minimal in the family
of all nonsingular extensions of < .
Theorem 11.10 Let = be a nonsingular finite-dimensional metric vector space
over - . We assume that char²- ³ £  when = is orthogonal.
1) Let : be a subspace of = . If # is isotropic and the orthogonal direct sum
span²#³ p :
exists, then there is a hyperbolic plane / ~ span²#Á '³ for which
/ p:
exists. In particular, if # is isotropic, then there is a hyperbolic plane
containing #.
2) Let < be a subspace of = and let
< ~ span²# Á Ã Á # ³ p >
where > is nonsingular and ¸# Á Ã Á # ¹ are linearly independent in
rad²< ³. Then there is a hyperbolic space > ~ / p Ä p / with
hyperbolic basis ²# Á ' Á Ã Á # Á ' ³ for which
< ~ > p >
is a nonsingular proper extension of < . If ¸# Á Ã Á # ¹ is a basis for
rad²< ³, then
dim²< ³ ~ dim²< ³ b dim²rad²< ³³

274

Advanced Linear Algebra

and we refer to < as a hyperbolic extension of < . If < is nonsingular, we
say that < is a hyperbolic extension of itself.
Proof. For part 1), the nonsingularity of = implies that :  ~ : . Hence,
# ¤ : ~ :  and so there is an %  :  for which º#Á %» £ . If = is
symplectic, then all vectors are isotropic and so we can take ' ~ ²°º#Á %»³%. If
= is orthogonal, let ' ~ # b %. The conditions defining ²#Á '³ as a hyperbolic
pair are (since # is isotropic)
 ~ º#Á '» ~ º#Á # b %» ~ º#Á %»
and
 ~ º'Á '» ~ º# b %Á # b %» ~  º#Á %» b



º%Á %» ~  b



º%Á %»

Since º#Á %» £ , the first of these equations can be solved for and since
char²- ³ £ , the second equation can then be solved for . Thus, in either case,
there is a vector '  :  for which / ~ span²#Á '³  :  is hyperbolic. Hence,
:  :   /  and since / is nonsingular, that is, / q /  ~ ¸¹, we have
/ q : ~ ¸¹ and so / p : exists.
Part 2) is proved by induction on  . Note first that all of the vectors # are
isotropic. If  ~ , then span²# ³ p > exists and so part 1) implies that there is
a hyperbolic plane / ~ span²# Á '³ for which / p > exists.
Assume that the result is true for independent sets of size less than   . Since
span²# ³ p span²# Á Ã Á # ³ p > 
exists, part 1) implies that there exists a hyperbolic plane / ~ span²# Á ' ³ for
which
/ p span²# Á Ã Á # ³ p > 
exists. Since # Á Ã Á # are in the radical of span²# Á Ã Á # ³ p > , the inductive
hypothesis implies that there is a hyperbolic space / p Ä p / with
hyperbolic basis ²# Á ' Á Ã Á # Á ' ³ for which the orthogonal direct sum
/ p Ä p /  p >
exists. Hence, / p Ä p / p > also exists.
We can now prove that the hyperbolic extensions of < are precisely the minimal
nonsingular extensions of < .
Theorem 11.11 (Nonsingular extension theorem) Let < be a subspace of a
nonsingular finite-dimensional metric vector space = . The following are
equivalent:
1) ; ~ > p > is a hyperbolic extension of <
2) ; is a minimal nonsingular extension of <

Metric Vector Spaces: The Theory of Bilinear Forms

275

3) ; is a nonsingular extension of < and
dim²; ³ ~ dim²< ³ b dim²rad²< ³³
Thus, any two nonsingular completions of < are isometric.
Proof. If <  ?  = where ? is nonsingular, then we may apply Theorem
11.10 to < as a subspace of ? , to obtain a hyperbolic extension A p > of <
for which
< Ap> ?
Thus, every nonsingular extension of < contains a hyperbolic extension of < .
Moreover, all hyperbolic extensions of < have the same dimension:
dim²> p > ³ ~ dim²< ³ b dim²rad²< ³³
and so no hyperbolic extension of < is properly contained in another hyperbolic
extension of < . This proves that 1)–3) are equivalent. The final statement
follows from the fact that hyperbolic spaces of the same dimension are
isometric.

Extending Isometries to Nonsingular Completions
Let = and = Z be isometric nonsingular metric vector spaces and let
< ~ rad²< ³ p > be a subspace of = , with nonsingular completion
< ~ > p >.
If  ¢ < ¦  < is an isometry, then it is a simple matter to extend  to an
isometry  from < onto a nonsingular completion of  < . To see this, let
²" Á ' Á Ã Á " Á ' ³ be a hyperbolic basis for >. Since ²" Á Ã Á " ³ is a basis for
rad²< ³, it follows that ² " Á Ã Á  " ³ is a basis for rad² < ³.
Hence, we can hyperbolically extend  < ~ rad² > ³ p  > to get
 < ~ >Z p  >
where >Z has hyperbolic basis ² " Á % Á Ã Á  " Á % ³. To extend  , simply set
' ~ % for all  ~ Á Ã Á  .
Theorem 11.12 Let = and = Z be isometric nonsingular metric vector spaces
and let < be a subspace of = , with nonsingular completion < . Any isometry
 ¢ < ¦  < can be extended to an isometry from < onto a nonsingular
completion of < .

The Witt Theorems: A Preview
There are two important theorems that are quite easy to prove in the case of real
inner product spaces, but require more work in the case of metric vector spaces
in general. Let = and = Z be isometric nonsingular metric vector spaces over a
field - . We assume that char²- ³ £  if = is orthogonal.

276

Advanced Linear Algebra

The Witt extension theorem says that if : is a subspace of = , then any isometry
¢ : ¦ :  = Z
can be extended to an isometry from = to = Z . The Witt cancellation theorem
says that if
= ~ : p :

and = Z ~ ; p ; 

then
:  ; ¬ :  ; 
We will prove these theorems in both the orthogonal and symplectic cases a bit
later in the chapter. For now, we simply want to show that it is easy to prove
one Witt theorem using the other.
Suppose that the Witt extension theorem holds and assume that
= ~ : p :

and = Z ~ ; p ; 

and :  ; . Then any isometry  ¢ : ¦ ; can be extended to an isometry  from
= to = Z . According to Theorem 11.9, we have  ²:  ³ ~ ;  and so :   ;  .
Hence, the Witt cancellation theorem holds.
Conversely, suppose that the Witt cancellation theorem holds and let
 ¢ : ¦  :  = Z be an isometry. Since  can be extended to a nonsingular
completion of : , we may assume that : is nonsingular. Then
= ~ : p :
Since  is an isometry, : is also nonsingular and we can write
= Z ~  : p ² :³
Since :   : , Witt's cancellation theorem implies that :   ² :³ . If
¢ :  ¦ ² :³ is an isometry, then the map ¢ = ¦ = Z defined by
²" b #³ ~  " b #
for "  : and #  :  is an isometry that extends  . Hence Witt's extension
theorem holds.

The Classification Problem for Metric Vector Spaces
The classification problem for a class of metric vector spaces (such as the
orthogonal or symplectic spaces) is the problem of determining when two metric
vector spaces in the class are isometric. The classification problem is considered
“solved,” at least in a theoretical sense, by finding a set of canonical forms or a
complete set of invariants for matrices under congruence.

Metric Vector Spaces: The Theory of Bilinear Forms

277

To see why, suppose that  ¢ = ¦ > is an isometry and 8 ~ ²# Á Ã Á # ³ is an
ordered basis for = . Then 9 ~ ² # Á Ã Á  # ³ is an ordered basis for > and
48 ²= ³ ~ ²º# Á # »³ ~ ²º # Á  # »³ ~ 49 ²> ³
Thus, the congruence class of matrices representing = is identical to the
congruence class of matrices representing > .
Conversely, suppose that = and > are metric vector spaces with the same
congruence class of representing matrices. Then if 8 ~ ²# Á Ã Á # ³ is an
ordered basis for = , there is an ordered basis 9 ~ ²$ Á Ã Á $ ³ for > for which
²º# Á # »³ ~ 48 ²= ³ ~ 49 ²> ³ ~ ²º$ Á $ »³
Hence, the map  ¢ = ¦ > defined by  # ~ $ is an isometry from = to > .
We have shown that two metric vector spaces are isometric if and only if they
have the same congruence class of representing matrices. Thus, we can
determine whether any two metric vector spaces are isometric by representing
each space with a matrix and determining whether these matrices are congruent,
using a set of canonical forms or a set of complete invariants.

Symplectic Geometry
We now turn to a study of the structure of orthogonal and symplectic geometries
and their isometries. Since the study of the structure (and the structure itself) of
symplectic geometries is simpler than that of orthogonal geometries, we begin
with the symplectic case. The reader who is interested only in the orthogonal
case may omit this section.
Throughout this section, let = be a nonsingular symplectic geometry.

The Classification of Symplectic Geometries
Among the simplest types of metric vector spaces are those that possess an
orthogonal basis. However, it is easy to see that a symplectic geometry = has an
orthogonal basis if and only if it is totally degenerate and so no “interesting”
symplectic geometries have orthogonal bases.
Thus, in searching for an orthogonal decomposition of = , we turn to twodimensional subspaces and this puts us in mind of hyperbolic spaces. Let < be
the family of all hyperbolic subspaces of = , which is nonempty since the zero
subspace ¸¹ is singular and so has a nonzero hyperbolic extension. Since = is
finite-dimensional, < has a maximal member >. Since > is nonsingular, if
> £ = , then
= ~ > p >
where > £ ¸¹. But then if #  > is nonzero, there is a hyperbolic extension

278

Advanced Linear Algebra

/ p > of > containing #, which contradicts the maximality of >. Hence,
= ~ >.
This proves the following structure theorem for symplectic geometries.
Theorem 11.13
1) A symplectic geometry has an orthogonal basis if and only if it is totally
degenerate.
2) Any nonsingular symplectic geometry = is a hyperbolic space, that is,
= ~ / p /  p Ä p / 
where each / is a hyperbolic plane. Thus, there is a hyperbolic basis for
= , that is, a basis 8 for which the matrix of the form is

In particular, the dimension of = is even.
3) Any symplectic geometry = has the form
= ~ rad²= ³ p >
where > is a hyperbolic space and rad²= ³ is a totally degenerate space.
The rank of the form is dim²>³ and = is uniquely determined up to
isometry by its rank and its dimension. Put another way, up to isometry,
there is precisely one symplectic geometry of each rank and dimension.
Symplectic forms are represented by alternate matrices, that is, skew-symmetric
matrices with zero diagonal. Moreover, according to Theorem 11.13, each
 d  alternate matrix is congruent to a matrix of the form

Since the rank of ?Ác is  , no two such matrices are congruent.
Theorem 11.14 The set of  d  matrices of the form ?Ác is a set of
canonical forms for alternate matrices under congruence.
The previous theorems solve the classification problem for symplectic
geometries by stating that the rank and dimension of = form a complete set of

Witt's Extension and Cancellation Theorems
We now prove the Witt theorems for symplectic geometries.
Theorem 11.15 (Witt's extension theorem) Let = and = Z be isometric
nonsingular symplectic geometries over a field - . Then any isometry
¢ : ¦ :  = Z
on a subspace : of = can be extended to an isometry from = to = Z .
Proof. According to Theorem 11.12, we can extend  to a nonsingular
completion of : , so we may simply assume that : and  : are nonsingular.
Hence,
= ~ : p :
and
= Z ~  : p ² :³
To complete the extension of  to = , we need only choose a hyperbolic basis
² Á  Á Ã Á  Á  ³
for :  and a hyperbolic basis
²Z Á Z Á Ã Á Z Á Z ³
for ² :³ and define the extension by setting   ~ Z and   ~ Z .
As a corollary to Witt's extension theorem, we have Witt's cancellation theorem.
Theorem 11.16 (Witt's cancellation theorem) Let = and = Z be isometric
nonsingular symplectic geometries over a field - . If

The Structure of the Symplectic Group: Symplectic Transvections
Let us examine the nature of symplectic transformations (isometries) on a
nonsingular symplectic geometry = . Recall that for a real vector space, an
isometric isomorphism, which corresponds to an isometry in the present context,
is the same as an orthogonal map and orthogonal maps are products of
reflections (Theorem 10.17). Recall also that a reflection /# is defined as an
operator for which

º#Á #»

In the present context, we do not dare divide by º#Á #», since all vectors are
isotropic. So here is the next-best thing.
Definition Let = be a nonsingular symplectic geometry over - . Let #  = be
nonzero and let   - . The map #Á ¢ = ¦ = defined by
#Á ²%³ ~ % b º%Á #»#
is called the symplectic transvection determined by # and .
Note that if  ~ , then #Á ~  and if  £ , then #Á is the identity precisely
on the subspace span²#³ of codimension . In the case of a reflection, /# is the
identity precisely on span²#³ and

However, for a symplectic transvection, #Á is the identity precisely on

symplectic transvections.
Theorem 11.17 Let #Á be a symplectic transvection on = . Then
1) #Á is a symplectic transformation (isometry).
2) #Á ~  if and only if  ~ .

We now wish to prove that any symplectic transformation on a nonsingular
symplectic geometry = is the product of symplectic transvections. The proof is
not difficult, but it is a bit lengthy, so we break it up into parts. Our first goal is
to show that we can get from any hyperbolic pair to any other hyperbolic pair
using a product of symplectic transvections.
Let us say that two hyperbolic pairs ²%Á &³ and ²$Á '³ are connected if there is a
product  of symplectic transvections that carries % to $ and & to ' and write
¢ ²%Á &³ ª ²$Á '³
or ²%Á &³ © ²$Á '³. It is clear that connectedness is an equivalence relation on
the set of hyperbolic pairs.
Theorem 11.18 In a nonsingular symplectic geometry = , every pair of
hyperbolic pairs are connected.
Proof. Note first that if º Á !» £ , then £ ! and so
 c!Á ~ b º Á c !»² c !³ ~ c º Á !»² c !³
Taking  ~ °º Á !» gives  c!Á ~ !. Therefore, if ² Á "³ is hyperbolic, then we
can always find a vector % for which
² Á "³ © ²!Á %³
namely, % ~  c!Á ". Also, if both ² Á "³ and ²!Á "³ are hyperbolic, then
² Á "³ © ²!Á "³
since º c !Á "» ~  and so  c!Á " ~ ".
Actually, these statements are still true if º Á !» ~ . For in this case, there is a
nonzero vector & for which º Á &» £  and º!Á &» £ . This follows from the fact
that there is an   = i for which  £  and  ! £  and so the Riesz vector 9
is such a vector. Therefore, if ² Á "³ is hyperbolic, then
² Á "³ © ²&Á  c&Á "³ © ²!Á &c!ÁZ  c&Á "³
and if both ² Á "³ and ²!Á "³ are hyperbolic, then
² Á "³ © ²&Á "³ © ²!Á "³
Hence, transitivity gives the same result as in the case º Á !» £ .
Finally, if ²" Á " ³ and ²# Á # ³ are hyperbolic, then there is a & for which
²" Á " ³ © ²# Á &³ © ²# Á # ³
and so transitivity shows that ²" Á " ³ © ²# Á # ³.

We can now show that the symplectic transvections generate the symplectic
group.
Theorem 11.19 Every symplectic transformation on a nonsingular symplectic
geometry = is the product of symplectic transvections.
Proof. Let  be a symplectic transformation on = . We proceed by induction on
 ~ dim²= ³. If  ~ , then = ~ / ~ span²"Á '³ is a hyperbolic plane and
Theorem 11.18 implies that there is a product  of symplectic transvections on
= for which
 ¢ ²"Á '³ ª ²"Á '³
This proves the result if  ~ . Assume that the result holds for all dimensions
less than  and let dim²= ³ ~  .
Now,
= ~/ pA
where / ~ span²"Á '³ and A is a symplectic geometry of dimension less than
that of = . As before, there is a product  of symplectic transvections on = for
which
 ¢ ²"Á '³ ª ²"Á '³
and so
 O/ ~ O/
Note that  c / ~ / and so Theorem 11.9 implies that  c ²/  ³ ~ /  .
Since dim²/  ³  dim²/³, the inductive hypothesis applied to the symplectic
transformation  c  on /  implies that there is a product  of symplectic
transvections on /  for which  ~  c . As remarked earlier,  is also a
product of symplectic transvections on = that is the identity on / and so
O/ ~ /

and

 ~  on / 

Thus,  ~  on both / and on /  and so  ~  is a product of symplectic
transvections on = .

The Structure of Orthogonal Geometries: Orthogonal Bases
We have seen that no interesting (that is, not totally degenerate) symplectic
geometries have orthogonal bases. By contrast, almost all interesting orthogonal
geometries = have orthogonal bases.
To understand why, it is convenient to group the orthogonal geometries into two
classes: those that are also symplectic and those that are not. The reason is that
all orthogonal nonsymplectic geometries have orthogonal bases, as we will see.
However, an orthogonal symplectic geometry has an orthogonal basis if and

Metric Vector Spaces: The Theory of Bilinear Forms

283

only if it is totally degenerate. Furthermore, we have seen that if char²- ³ £ ,
then all orthogonal symplectic geometries are totally degenerate and so all such
geometries have orthogonal bases. But if char²- ³ ~ , then there are orthogonal
symplectic geometries that are not totally degenerate and therefore do not have
orthogonal bases.
Thus, if we exclude orthogonal symplectic geometries when char²- ³ ~ , we
can say that every orthogonal geometry has an orthogonal basis.
If a metric vector space = has an orthogonal basis, the natural next step is to
look for an orthonormal basis. However, if = is singular, then there is a nonzero
vector #  =  and such a vector can never be a linear combination of vectors
from an orthonormal basis ¸" Á Ã Á " ¹, since the coefficients in such a linear
combination are º#Á " » ~ .
However, even if = is nonsingular, orthonormal bases do not always exist and
the question of how close we can come to such an orthonormal basis depends on
the nature of the base field. We will examine this issue in three cases:
algebraically closed fields, the field of real numbers and finite fields.
We should also mention that even when = has an orthogonal basis, the Gram–
Schmidt orthogonalization process may not apply to produce such a basis,
because even nonsingular orthogonal geometries may have isotropic vectors,
and so division by º"Á "» is problematic.
For example, consider an orthogonal hyperbolic plane / ~ span²"Á #³ and
assume that char²- ³ £ . Thus, " and # are isotropic and º"Á #» ~ . The
vector " cannot be extended to an orthogonal basis using the Gram–Schmidt
process, since ¸"Á " b #¹ is orthogonal if and only if  ~ . However, / does
have an orthogonal basis, namely, ¸" b #Á " c #¹.

Orthogonal Bases
Let = be an orthogonal geometry. As we have discussed, if = is also
symplectic, then = has an orthogonal basis if and only if it is totally degenerate.
Moreover, when char²- ³ £ , all orthogonal symplectic geometries are totally
degenerate and so all orthogonal symplectic geometries have an orthogonal
basis.
If = is orthogonal but not symplectic, then = contains a nonisotropic vector " ,
the subspace span²" ³ is nonsingular and
= ~ span²" ³ p =
where = ~ span²" ³ . If = is not symplectic, then we may decompose it to get
= ~ span²" ³ p span²" ³ p =

284

Advanced Linear Algebra

This process may be continued until we reach a decomposition
= ~ span²" ³ p Ä p span²" ³ p <
where < is symplectic as well as orthogonal. (This includes the case < ~ ¸¹.)
Let 8 ~ ²" Á Ã Á " ³.
If char²- ³ £ , then < is totally degenerate. Thus, if 9 is a basis for < , then the
union 8 r 9 is an orthogonal basis for = . If char²- ³ ~ , then
< ~ > p rad²< ³, where > is hyperbolic and so
= ~ span²" ³ p Ä p span²" ³ p > p rad²< ³
where rad²< ³ is totally degenerate and the " are nonisotropic. If
9 ~ ²% Á & Á Ã Á % Á & ³ is a hyperbolic basis for > and : ~ ²' Á Ã Á ' ³ is an
ordered basis for rad²< ³, then the union
; ~ 8 r 9 r : ~ ²" Á Ã Á " Á % Á & Á Ã Á % Á & Á ' Á Ã Á ' ³
is an ordered orthogonal basis for = . However, we can do better (in some
sense).
The following lemma says that when char²- ³ ~ , a pair of isotropic basis
vectors, such as % Á & , can be replaced by a pair of nonisotropic basis vectors,
when coupled with a nonisotropic basis vector, such as " .
Lemma 11.20 Suppose that char²- ³ ~ . Let > be a three-dimensional
orthogonal geometry of the form
> ~ span²#³ p span²%Á &³
where # is nonisotropic and / ~ span²%Á &³ is a hyperbolic plane. Then
> ~ span²# ³ p span²# ³ p span²# ³
where each # is nonisotropic.
Proof. It is straightforward to check that if º#Á #» ~ , then the vectors
# ~ " b % b &
# ~ " b %
# ~ " b ² c ³% b &
are linearly independent and mutually orthogonal. Details are left to the
reader.
Using the previous lemma, we can replace the vectors ¸" Á % Á & ¹ with the
nonisotropic vectors ¸# Á #b Á #b ¹, while retaining orthogonality. Moreover,
the replacement process can continue until the isotropic vectors are absorbed,
leaving an orthogonal basis of nonisotropic vectors.

Let us summarize.
Theorem 11.21 Let = be an orthogonal geometry.
1) If = is also symplectic, then = has an orthogonal basis if and only if it is
totally degenerate. When char²- ³ £ , all orthogonal symplectic
geometries have an orthogonal basis, but this is not the case when
char²- ³ ~ .
2) If = is not symplectic, then = has an ordered orthogonal basis
8 ~ ²" Á Ã Á " Á ' Á Ã Á ' ³ for which º" Á " » ~  £  and º' Á ' » ~ .

with  ~ rk²48 ³ nonzero entries on the diagonal.
As a corollary, we get a nice theorem about symmetric matrices.
Corollary 11.22 Let 4 be a symmetric matrix and assume that 4 is not
alternate if char²- ³ ~ . Then 4 is congruent to a diagonal matrix.

The Classification of Orthogonal Geometries: Canonical
Forms
We now want to consider the question of improving upon Theorem 11.21. The
diagonal matrices of this theorem do not form a set of canonical forms for
congruence. In fact, if  Á Ã Á  are nonzero scalars, then the matrix of = with
respect to the basis 9 ~ ² " Á Ã Á  " Á ' Á Ã Á ' ³ is

Hence, 48 and 49 are congruent diagonal matrices. Thus, by a simple change
of basis, we can multiply any diagonal entry by a nonzero square in - .
The determination of a set of canonical forms for symmetric (nonalternate when
char²- ³ ~ ) matrices under congruence depends on the properties of the base
field. Our plan is to consider three types of base fields: algebraically closed

Now let us turn to the details.

Algebraically Closed Fields
If - is algebraically closed, then for every   - , the polynomial % c  has a
root in - , that is, every element of - has a square root in - . Therefore, we may
choose  ~ °j in (11.2), which leads to the following result.

Theorem 11.23 Let = be an orthogonal geometry over an algebraically closed

with  ones and  zeros on the diagonal. In particular, if = is nonsingular,
then = has an orthonormal basis.
The matrix version of Theorem 11.23 follows.
Theorem 11.24 Let I be the set of all  d  symmetric matrices over an
algebraically closed field - . If char²- ³ ~ , we restrict I to the set of all
symmetric matrices with at least one nonzero entry on the main diagonal.
1) Any matrix 4 in I is congruent to a unique matrix of the form ZÁ , in
fact,  ~ rk²4 ³ and  ~  c rk²4 ³.
2) The set of all matrices of the form ZÁ for  b  ~  is a set of canonical
forms for congruence on I .
3) The rank of a matrix is a complete invariant for congruence on I .

The Real Field s
If - ~ s, we can choose  ~ °j( (, so that all nonzero diagonal elements in
(11.2) will be either ,  or c.

with  ones,  negative ones and  zeros on the diagonal.
Here is the matrix version of Theorem 11.25.
Theorem 11.26 Let I be the set of all  d  symmetric matrices over the real

1) Any matrix in I is congruent to a unique matrix of the form ZÁÁ Á for
some Á  and  ~  c  c .
2) The set of all matrices of the form ZÁÁ for  b  b  ~  is a set of

3) Let 4  I and let 4 be congruent to AÁÁ . Then  b  is the rank of
4 and  c  is the signature of 4 and the triple ²Á Á ³ is the inertia
of 4 . The pair ²Á ³, or equivalently the pair ² b Á  c ³, is a
complete invariant under congruence on I .
Proof. We need only prove the uniqueness statement in part 1). Let
8 ~ ²" Á Ã Á " Á # Á Ã Á # Á ' Á Ã Á ' ³

9 ~ ²"Z Á Ã Á "ZZ Á #Z Á Ã Á #ZZ 'Z Á Ã Á 'Z Z ³
be ordered bases for which the matrices 48 and 49 have the form shown in
Theorem 11.25. Since the rank of these matrices must be equal, we have
 b  ~ Z b Z and so  ~  Z .

that is,   Z . By symmetry, Z   and so  ~ Z . Finally, since  ~  Z , it
follows that  ~ Z .

Finite Fields
To deal with the case of finite fields, we must know something about the
distribution of squares in finite fields, as well as the possible values of the
scalars º#Á #».
Theorem 11.27 Let - be a finite field with  elements.
1) If char²- ³ ~ , then every element of - is a square.
2) If char²- ³ £ , then exactly half of the nonzero elements of - are
squares, that is, there are ² c ³° nonzero squares in - . Moreover, if %
is any nonsquare in - , then all nonsquares have the form  %, for some
  - .
Proof. Write - ~ - , let - i be the subgroup of all nonzero elements in - and
let
²- i ³ ~ ¸    - i ¹
be the subgroup of all nonzero squares in - . The Frobenius map
¢ - i ¦ ²- i ³ defined by ²³ ~  is a surjective group homomorphism, with
kernel
ker²³ ~ ¸  -   ~ ¹ ~ ¸cÁ ¹
If char²- ³ ~ , then ker²³ ~ ¸¹ and so  is bijective and (- i ( ~ (²- i ³ (,
which proves part 1). If char²- ³ £ , then (ker²³( ~  and so (- i ( ~ (²- i ³ (,
which proves the first part of part 2). We leave proof of the last statement to the
reader.
Definition A bilinear form on = is universal if for any nonzero   - there

Theorem 11.28 Let = be an orthogonal geometry over a finite field - with

Theorem 11.29 Let = be an orthogonal geometry over a finite field - and

Now consider the nonsingular orthogonal geometry = ~ span²" Á " ³.
According to Theorem 11.28, the form is universal when restricted to = .
Hence, there exists a #  = for which º# Á # » ~ .
Now, # ~ " b " for Á  - not both , and we may swap " and " if
necessary to ensure that  £ . Hence,
8 ~ ²# Á " Á Ã Á " Á ' Á Ã Á ' ³
is an ordered basis for = for which the matrix 48 is diagonal and has a  in the
upper left entry. We can repeat the process with the subspace = ~ span²# Á # ³.
Continuing in this way, we can find an ordered basis
9 ~ ²# Á # Á Ã Á # Á ' Á Ã Á ' ³
for which 49 ~ ? ²³ for some nonzero   - . Now, if  is a square in - ,
then we can replace # by ²°j³# to get a basis : for which 4: ~ ? ²³. If
 is not a square in - , then  ~   for some   - and so replacing # by

Theorem 11.30 Let I be the set of all  d  symmetric matrices over a finite
field - . If char²- ³ ~ , we restrict I to the set of all symmetric matrices with
at least one nonzero entry on the main diagonal.
1) If char²- ³ ~ , then any matrix in I is congruent to a unique matrix of the
form ? ²³ and the matrices ¸? ²³   ~ Á Ã Á ¹ form a set of
canonical forms for I under congruence. Also, the rank is a complete

2) If char²- ³ £ , let  be a fixed nonsquare in - . Then any matrix I is
congruent to a unique matrix of the form ? ²³ or ? ²³. The set
¸? ²³Á ? ²³   ~ Á Ã Á ¹ is a set of canonical forms for congruence
on I . (Thus, there are exactly two congruence classes for each rank  .)

The Orthogonal Group
Having “settled” the classification question for orthogonal geometries over
certain types of fields, let us turn to a discussion of the structure-preserving
maps, that is, the isometries.

Rotations and Reflections
We begin by examining the matrix of an orthogonal transformation. If 8 is an
ordered basis for = , then for any %Á &  = ,
º%Á &» ~ ´%µ!8 48 ´&µ8
and so if   B²= ³, then
º %Á  &» ~ ´ %µ!8 48 ´ &µ8 ~ ´%µ!8 ²´ µ!8 48 ´ µ8 ³´&µ8
Hence,  is an orthogonal transformation if and only if

292

Advanced Linear Algebra

´ µ!8 48 ´ µ8 ~ 48
Taking determinants gives
det²48 ³ ~ det²´ µ8 ³ det²48 ³
Therefore, if = is nonsingular, then
det²´ µ8 ³ ~ f 
Since the determinant is an invariant under similarity, we have the following
theorem.
Theorem 11.31 Let  be an orthogonal transformation on a nonsingular
orthogonal geometry = .
1) det²´ µ8 ³ is the same for all ordered bases 8 for = and
det²´ µ8 ³ ~ f 
This determinant is called the determinant of  and denoted by det² ³.
2) If det² ³ ~ , then  is called a rotation and if det² ³ ~ c, then  is
called a reflection.
3) The set Eb ²= ³ of rotations is a subgroup of the orthogonal group E²= ³
and the determinant map det¢ E²= ³ ¦ ¸cÁ ¹ is an epimorphism with
kernel Eb ²= ³. Hence, if char²- ³ £ , then Eb ²= ³ is a normal subgroup
of E²= ³ of index .

For real inner product spaces, Theorem 10.16 says that if )#) ~ )$) £ , then
/#c$ is the unique reflection sending # to $, that is, /#c$ ²#³ ~ $. In the
present context, we must be careful, since symmetries are defined for
nonisotropic vectors only. Here is what we can say.
Theorem 11.32 Let = be a nonsingular orthogonal geometry over a field - ,
with char²- ³ £ . If "Á #  = are nonisotropic vectors with the same (nonzero)
“length,” that is, if
º"Á "» ~ º#Á #» £ 
then there exists a symmetry  for which
" ~ # or " ~ c#
Proof. Since " and # are nonisotropic, one of " c # or " b # must also be
nonisotropic, for otherwise, since " c # and " b # are orthogonal, their sum "
would also be isotropic. If " b # is nonisotropic, then
"b# ²" b #³ ~ c²" b #³
and
"b# ²" c #³ ~ " c #
and so "b# " ~ c#. On the other hand, if " c # is nonisotropic, then
"c# ²" c #³ ~ c²" c #³
and
"c# ²" b #³ ~ " b #
and so "c# " ~ #.
Recall that an operator on a real inner product space is unitary if and only if it is
a product of reflections. Here is the generalization to nonsingular orthogonal
geometries.
Theorem 11.33 Let = be a nonsingular orthogonal geometry over a field with char²- ³ £ . A linear transformation  on = is an orthogonal
transformation if and only if  is the product of symmetries on = .
Proof. The proof is by induction on  ~ dim²= ³. If  ~ , then = ~ span²#³
where º#Á #» £ . Let  # ~ # for   - . Since  is unitary
 º#Á #» ~ º#Á #» ~ º #Á  #» ~ º#Á #»
and so  ~ f. If  ~ , then  is the identity, which is equal to # . On the
other hand, if  ~ c then  ~ # . In either case,  is a product of symmetries.

Assume now that the theorem is true for dimensions less than  and let
dim²= ³ ~  . Let #  = be nonisotropic. Since º #Á  #» ~ º#Á #» £ , Theorem
11.32 implies the existence of a symmetry  on = for which
² #³ ~ #
where  ~ f . Thus,  ~ f on span²#³. Since Theorem 11.9 implies that
span²#³ is  -invariant, we may apply the induction hypothesis to  on
span²#³ to get
 Ospan²#³ ~ $ Ä$ ~ 
where $  span²#³ and each $ is a symmetry on span²#³ . But each $ can
be extended to a symmetry on = by setting $ # ~ #. Assume that  is the
extension of  to = , where  ~  on span²#³. Hence,  ~  on span²#³ and
 ~  on span²#³.
If  ~ , then  ~  on = and so  ~ , which completes the proof. If
 ~ c, then  ~ #  on span²#³ since # is the identity on span²#³ and
 ~ #  on span²#³. Hence,  ~ #  on = and so  ~ #  on = .

The Witt Theorems for Orthogonal Geometries
We are now ready to consider the Witt theorems for orthogonal geometries.
Theorem 11.34 (Witt's cancellation theorem) Let = and > be isometric
nonsingular orthogonal geometries over a field - with char²- ³ £ . Suppose
that
= ~ : p :

and > ~ ; p ; 

Then
:  ; ¬ :  ; 
Proof. First, we prove that it is sufficient to consider the case = ~ > . Suppose
that the result holds when = ~ > and that ¢ = ¦ > is an isometry. Then
²:³ p ²:  ³ ~ ²: p :  ³ ~ = ~ > ~ ; p ; 
Furthermore, :  :  ; . We can therefore apply the theorem to > to get
:   ²:  ³  ; 
as desired. To prove the theorem when = ~ > , assume that
= ~ : p : ~ ; p ; 
where : and ; are nonsingular and :  ; . Let  ¢ : ¦ ; be an isometry. We
proceed by induction on dim²:³.

Metric Vector Spaces: The Theory of Bilinear Forms

295

Suppose first that dim²:³ ~  and that : ~ span² ³. Since
º Á  » ~ º Á » £ 
Theorem 11.32 implies that there is a symmetry  for which  ~  where
 ~ f . Hence,  is an isometry of = for which ; ~ : and Theorem 11.9
implies that ;  ~ ²:  ³. Thus, O:  is the desired isometry.
Now suppose the theorem is true for dim²:³   and let dim²:³ ~  . Let
¢ : ¦ ; be an isometry. Since : is nonsingular, we can choose a nonisotropic
vector  : and write : ~ span² ³ p < , where < is nonsingular. It follows
that
= ~ : p :  ~ span² ³ p < p : 
and
= ~ ; p ;  ~  ²span² ³³ p  < p ; 
Now we may apply the one-dimensional case to deduce that
< p :  < p ; 
If ¢ < p :  ¦  < p ;  is an isometry, then
< p ²:  ³ ~ ²< p :  ³ ~  < p ; 
But <   < and since dim²< ³ ~ dim²< ³   , the induction hypothesis
implies that :   ²:  ³  ;  .
As we have seen, Witt's extension theorem is a corollary of Witt's cancellation
theorem.
Theorem 11.35 (Witt's extension theorem) Let = and = Z be isometric
nonsingular orthogonal geometries over a field - , with char²- ³ £ . Suppose
that < is a subspace of = and
¢ < ¦ <  = Z
is an isometry. Then  can be extended to an isometry from = to = Z .

Maximal Hyperbolic Subspaces of an Orthogonal Geometry
We have seen that any orthogonal geometry = can be written in the form
= ~ < p rad²= ³
where < is nonsingular. Nonsingular spaces are better behaved than singular
ones, but they can still possess isotropic vectors.

296

Advanced Linear Algebra

We can improve upon the preceding decomposition by noticing that if "  < is
isotropic, then Theorem 11.10 implies that span²"³ can be “captured” in a
hyperbolic plane / ~ span²"Á %³. Then we can write
= ~ / p / < p rad²= ³
where / < is the orthogonal complement of / in < and has “one fewer”
isotropic vector. In order to generalize this process, we first discuss maximal
totally degenerate subspaces.

Maximal Totally Degenerate Subspaces
Let = be a nonsingular orthogonal geometry over a field - , with char²- ³ £ .
Suppose that < and < Z are maximal totally degenerate subspaces of = . We
claim that dim²< ³ ~ dim²< Z ³. For if dim²< ³  dim²< Z ³, then there is a vector
space isomorphism  ¢ < ¦  <  < Z , which is also an isometry, since < and
< Z are totally degenerate. Thus, Witt's extension theorem implies the existence
of an isometry  ¢ = ¦ = that extends  . In particular,  c ²< Z ³ is a totally
degenerate space that contains < and so  c ²< Z ³ ~ < , which shows that
dim²< ³ ~ dim²< Z ³.
Theorem 11.36 Let = be a nonsingular orthogonal geometry over a field - ,
with char²- ³ £ .
1) All maximal totally degenerate subspaces of = have the same dimension,
which is called the Witt index of = and is denoted by $²= ³.
2) Any totally degenerate subspace of = of dimension $²= ³ is maximal.

Maximal Hyperbolic Subspaces
We can prove by a similar argument that all maximal hyperbolic subspaces of =
have the same dimension. Let
> ~ / p Ä p /
and
A ~ 2 p Ä p 2
be maximal hyperbolic subspaces of = and suppose that / ~ span²" Á # ³ and
2 ~ span²% Á & ³. We may assume that dim²>³  dim²A³.
The linear map  ¢ > ¦ A defined by
 "  ~ %  Á  #  ~ &
is clearly an isometry from > to >. Thus, Witt's extension theorem implies the
existence of an isometry  ¢ = ¦ = that extends  . In particular,  c ²A³ is a
hyperbolic space that contains > and so  c ²A³ ~ >. It follows that dim²A³
~ dim²>³.

It is not hard to see that the maximum dimension ²= ³ of a hyperbolic subspace
of = is $²= ³, where $²= ³ is the Witt index of = . First, the nonsingular
extension of a maximal totally degenerate subspace <$ of = is a hyperbolic
space of dimension $²= ³ and so ²= ³  $²= ³. On the other hand, there is a
totally degenerate subspace < contained in any hyperbolic space > and so
  $²= ³, that is, dim²> ³  $²= ³. Hence ²= ³  $²= ³ and so
²= ³ ~ $²= ³.
Theorem 11.37 Let = be a nonsingular orthogonal geometry over a field - ,
with char²- ³ £ .
1) All maximal hyperbolic subspaces of = have dimension $²= ³.
2) Any hyperbolic subspace of dimension $²= ³ must be maximal.
3) The Witt index of a hyperbolic space > is  .

The Anisotropic Decomposition of an Orthogonal Geometry
If > is a maximal hyperbolic subspace of = , then
= ~ > p >
Since > is maximal, > is anisotropic, for if "  > were isotropic, then the
nonsingular extension of > p span²"³ would be a hyperbolic space strictly
larger than >.
Thus, we arrive at the following decomposition theorem for orthogonal
geometries.
Theorem 11.38 (The anisotropic decomposition of an orthogonal geometry)
Let = ~ < p rad²= ³ be an orthogonal geometry over - , with char²- ³ £ . Let
> be a maximal hyperbolic subspace of < , where > ~ ¸¹ if < has no
isotropic vectors. Then
= ~ : p > p rad²= ³
where : is anisotropic, > is hyperbolic of dimension $²= ³ and rad²= ³ is
totally degenerate.

Metric Spaces

The Definition
In Chapter 9, we studied the basic properties of real and complex inner product
spaces. Much of what we did does not depend on whether the space in question
is finite-dimensional or infinite-dimensional. However, as we discussed in
Chapter 9, the presence of an inner product and hence a metric, on a vector
space, raises a host of new issues related to convergence. In this chapter, we
discuss briefly the concept of a metric space. This will enable us to study the
convergence properties of real and complex inner product spaces.
A metric space is not an algebraic structure. Rather it is designed to model the
abstract properties of distance.
Definition A metric space is a pair ²4 Á ³, where 4 is a nonempty set and
¢ 4 d 4 ¦ s is a real-valued function, called a metric on 4 , with the
following properties. The expression ²%Á &³ is read “the distance from % to & .”
1) (Positive definiteness) For all %Á &  4 ,
²%Á &³  
and ²%Á &³ ~  if and only if % ~ &.
2) (Symmetry) For all %Á &  4 ,
²%Á &³ ~ ²&Á %³
3) (Triangle inequality) For all %Á &Á '  4 ,
²%Á &³  ²%Á '³ b ²'Á &³
As is customary, when there is no cause for confusion, we simply say “let 4 be
a metric space.”

If 4 is a metric space under a metric  , then any nonempty subset : of 4 is
also a metric under the restriction of  to : d : . The metric space : thus
obtained is called a subspace of 4 .

Open and Closed Sets
Definition Let 4 be a metric space. Let %  4 and let  be a positive real
number.
1) The open ball centered at % , with radius , is
)²% Á ³ ~ ¸%  4  ²%Á % ³  ¹
2) The closed ball centered at % , with radius , is

3) The sphere centered at % , with radius , is
:²% Á ³ ~ ¸%  4  ²%Á % ³ ~ ¹
Definition A subset : of a metric space 4 is said to be open if each point of :
is the center of an open ball that is contained completely in : . More
specifically, : is open if for all %  : , there exists an    such that
)²%Á ³  : . Note that the empty set is open. A set ;  4 is closed if its
complement ;  in 4 is open.
It is easy to show that an open ball is an open set and a closed ball is a closed
set. If %  4 , we refer to any open set : containing % as an open
neighborhood of %. It is also easy to see that a set is open if and only if it
contains an open neighborhood of each of its points.
The next example shows that it is possible for a set to be both open and closed,
or neither open nor closed.
Example 12.5 In the metric space s with the usual Euclidean metric, the open
balls are just the open intervals

Observe also that the empty set is both open and closed, as is the entire space s.
(Although we will not do so, it is possible to show that these are the only two
sets that are both open and closed in s.³
It is not our intention to enter into a detailed discussion of open and closed sets,
the subject of which belongs to the branch of mathematics known as topology.
In order to put these concepts in perspective, however, we have the following
result, whose proof is left to the reader.
Theorem 12.1 The collection E of all open subsets of a metric space 4 has the
following properties:
1) J  E , 4  E
2) If : , ;  E then : q ;  E
3) If ¸:    2¹ is any collection of open sets, then 2 :  E .
These three properties form the basis for an axiom system that is designed to
generalize notions such as convergence and continuity and leads to the
following definition.
Definition Let ? be a nonempty set. A collection E of subsets of ? is called a
topology for ? if it has the following properties:
1) J  EÁ ?  E
2) If :Á ;  E then : q ;  E
3) If ¸:    2¹ is any collection of sets in E , then  :  E .
2

We refer to subsets in E as open sets and the pair ²?Á E³ as a topological
space.
According to Theorem 12.1, the open sets (as we defined them earlier) in a
metric space 4 form a topology for 4 , called the topology induced by the
metric.
Topological spaces are the most general setting in which we can define concepts
such as convergence and continuity, which is why these concepts are called
topological concepts. However, since the topologies with which we will be
dealing are induced by a metric, we will generally phrase the definitions of the
topological properties that we will need directly in terms of the metric.

Convergence in a Metric Space
Convergence of sequences in a metric space is defined as follows.
Definition A sequence ²% ³ in a metric space 4 converges to %  4 , written
²% ³ ¦ %, if
lim ²% Á %³ ~ 

¦B

Equivalently, ²% ³ ¦ % if for any   , there exists an 5   such that

  5 ¬ ²% Á %³  
or equivalently,
  5 ¬ %  )²%Á ³
In this case, % is called the limit of the sequence ²% ³.
If 4 is a metric space and : is a subset of 4 , by a sequence in : , we mean a
sequence whose terms all lie in : . We next characterize closed sets and
therefore also open sets, using convergence.
Theorem 12.2 Let 4 be a metric space. A subset :  4 is closed if and only if
whenever ²% ³ is a sequence in : and ²% ³ ¦ %, then %  : . In loose terms, a
subset : is closed if it is closed under the taking of sequential limits.
Proof. Suppose that : is closed and let ²% ³ ¦ %, where %  : for all .
Suppose that % ¤ : . Then since %  :  and :  is open, there exists an    for
which %  )²%Á ³  :  . But this implies that
)²%Á ³ q ¸% ¹ ~ J
which contradicts the fact that ²% ³ ¦ %. Hence, %  : .
Conversely, suppose that : is closed under the taking of limits. We show that
:  is open. Let %  :  and suppose to the contrary that no open ball about % is
contained in :  . Consider the open balls )²%Á °³, for all   . Since none of
these balls is contained in :  , for each , there is an %  : q )²%Á °³. It is
clear that ²% ³ ¦ % and so %  : . But % cannot be in both : and :  . This
contradiction implies that :  is open. Thus, : is closed.

The Closure of a Set
Definition Let : be any subset of a metric space 4 . The closure of : , denoted
by cl²:³, is the smallest closed set containing : .
We should hasten to add that, since the entire space 4 is closed and since the
intersection of any collection of closed sets is closed (exercise), the closure of
any set : does exist and is the intersection of all closed sets containing : . The
following definition will allow us to characterize the closure in another way.
Definition Let : be a nonempty subset of a metric space 4 . An element %  4
is said to be a limit point, or accumulation point, of : if every open ball
centered at % meets : at a point other than % itself. Let us denote the set of all
limit points of : by M²:³.
Here are some key facts concerning limit points and closures.

Theorem 12.3 Let : be a nonempty subset of a metric space 4 .
1) %  M²:³ if and only if there is a sequence ²% ³ in : for which % £ % for
all  and ²% ³ ¦ %.
2) : is closed if and only if M²:³  : . In words, : is closed if and only if it
contains all of its limit points.
3) cl²:³ ~ : r M²:³.
4) %  cl²:³ if and only if there is a sequence ²% ³ in : for which ²% ³ ¦ %.
Proof. For part 1), assume first that %  M²:³. For each , there exists a point
% £ % such that %  )²%Á °³ q : . Thus, we have
²% Á %³  °
and so ²% ³ ¦ %. For the converse, suppose that ²% ³ ¦ %, where % £ %  : .
If )²%Á ³ is any ball centered at %, then there is some 5 such that   5
implies %  )²%Á ³. Hence, for any ball )²%Á ³ centered at %, there is a point
% £ % such that %  : q )²%Á ³. Thus, % is a limit point of : .
As for part 2), if : is closed, then by part 1), any %  M²:³ is the limit of a
sequence ²% ³ in : and so must be in : . Hence, M²:³  : . Conversely, if
M²:³  : , then : is closed. For if ²% ³ is any sequence in : and ²% ³ ¦ %, then
there are two possibilities. First, we might have % ~ % for some , in which
case % ~ %  : . Second, we might have % £ % for all , in which case
²% ³ ¦ % implies that %  M²:³  : . In either case, %  : and so : is closed
under the taking of limits, which implies that : is closed.
For part 3), let ; ~ : r M²:³. Clearly, :  ; . To show that ; is closed, we
show that it contains all of its limit points. So let %  M²; ³. Hence, there is a
sequence ²% ³  ; for which % £ % and ²% ³ ¦ %. Of course, each % is
either in : , or is a limit point of : . We must show that %  ; , that is, that % is
either in : or is a limit point of : .
Suppose for the purposes of contradiction that % ¤ : and % ¤ M²:³. Then there
is a ball )²%Á ³ for which )²%Á ³ q : £ J. However, since ²% ³ ¦ %, there
must be an %  )²%Á ³. Since % cannot be in : , it must be a limit point of : .
Referring to Figure 12.1, if ²% Á %³ ~   , then consider the ball
)²% Á ²c³°³. This ball is completely contained in )²%Á ³ and must contain
an element & of : , since its center % is a limit point of : . But then
&  : q )²%Á ³, a contradiction. Hence, %  : or %  M²:³. In either case,
%  ; ~ : r M²:³ and so ; is closed.
Thus, ; is closed and contains : and so cl²:³  ; . On the other hand,
; ~ : r M²:³  cl²:³ and so cl²:³ ~ ; .
