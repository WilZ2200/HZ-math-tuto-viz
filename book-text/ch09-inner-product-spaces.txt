1)  is an isometry if it preserves the inner product, that is, if
º "Á  #» ~ º"Á #»
for all "Á #  = .
2) A bijective isometry is called an isometric isomorphism. When ¢ = ¦ >
is an isometric isomorphism, we say that = and > are isometrically
isomorphic.
It is clear that an isometry is injective and so it is an isometric isomorphism
provided it is surjective. Moreover, if
dim²= ³ ~ dim²> ³  B
injectivity implies surjectivity and  is an isometry if and only if  is an
isometric isomorphism. On the other hand, the following simple example shows
that this is not the case for infinite-dimensional inner product spaces.
Example 9.3 The map ¢ M ¦ M defined by
²% Á % Á % Á Ã ³ ~ ²Á % Á % Á Ã ³
is an isometry, but it is clearly not surjective.
Since the norm determines the inner product, the following should not come as a
surprise.
Theorem 9.6 A linear transformation   B²= Á > ³ is an isometry if and only if
it preserves the norm, that is, if and only if
)#) ~ )#)
for all #  = .
Proof. Clearly, an isometry preserves the norm. The converse follows from the
polarization identities. In the real case, we have

and so  is an isometry. The complex case is similar.

Orthogonality
The presence of an inner product allows us to define the concept of
orthogonality.

Definition Let = be an inner product space.
1) Two vectors "Á #  = are orthogonal, written "  #, if
º"Á #» ~ 
2) Two subsets ?Á @  = are orthogonal, written ?  @ , if º?Á @ » ~ ¸¹,
that is, if %  & for all %  ? and &  @ . We write #  ? in place of
¸#¹  ?.
3) The orthogonal complement of a subset ?  = is the set
?  ~ ¸#  =  #  ?¹
The following result is easily proved.
Theorem 9.7 Let = be an inner product space.
1) The orthogonal complement ?  of any subset ?  = is a subspace of = .
2) For any subspace : of = ,

Definition An inner product space = is the orthogonal direct sum of

In this case, we write

More generally, = is the orthogonal direct sum of the subspaces : Á Ã Á : ,
written
: ~ : p Ä p :
if

and

:  : for  £ 

Theorem 9.8 Let = be an inner product space. The following are equivalent.
1) = ~ : p ;
2) = ~ : l ; and ; ~ : 
Proof. If = ~ : p ; , then by definition, ;  :  . However, if #  :  , then
# ~ b ! where  : and !  ; . Then is orthogonal to both ! and # and so
is orthogonal to itself, which implies that ~  and so #  ; . Hence, ; ~ :  .
The converse is clear.

Orthogonal and Orthonormal Sets
Definition A nonempty set E ~ ¸"    2¹ of vectors in an inner product
space is said to be an orthogonal set if "  " for all  £   2 . If, in
addition, each vector " is a unit vector, then E is an orthonormal set. Thus, a

Real and Complex Inner Product Spaces

213

set is orthonormal if
º" Á " » ~ Á
for all Á   2 , where Á is the Kronecker delta function.
Of course, given any nonzero vector #  = , we may obtain a unit vector " by
multiplying # by the reciprocal of its norm:
"~


#
)#)

This process is referred to as normalizing the vector #. Thus, it is a simple
matter to construct an orthonormal set from an orthogonal set of nonzero
vectors.
Note that if "  #, then
)" b #) ~ )") b )#)
and the converse holds if - ~ s.
Orthogonality is stronger than linear independence.
Theorem 9.9 Any orthogonal set of nonzero vectors in = is linearly
independent.
Proof. If E ~ ¸"    2¹ is an orthogonal set of nonzero vectors and
 " b Ä b  " ~ 
then
 ~ º " b Ä b  " Á " » ~  º" Á " »
and so  ~ , for all  . Hence, E is linearly independent.

Gram–Schmidt Orthogonalization
The Gram–Schmidt process can be used to transform a sequence of vectors into
an orthogonal sequence. We begin with the following.
Theorem 9.10 (Gram–Schmidt augmentation) Let = be an inner product
space and let E ~ ¸" Á Ã Á " ¹ be an orthogonal set of vectors in = . If
# ¤ º" Á Ã Á " », then there is a nonzero "  = for which ¸" Á Ã Á " Á "¹ is
orthogonal and

The QR Factorization
The Gram–Schmidt process can be used to factor any real or complex matrix
into a product of a matrix with orthogonal columns and an upper triangular
matrix. Suppose that ( ~ ²#  #  Ä  # ³ is an  d  matrix with columns
# , where   . The Gram–Schmidt process applied to these columns gives
orthogonal vectors 6 ~ ²"  "  Ä  " ³ for which

( ~ 89
where the columns of 8 are orthogonal and each column is either a unit vector
or the zero vector and 9 is upper triangular with positive entries on the main
diagonal. Moreover, if the vectors # Á Ã Á # are linearly independent, then the
columns of 8 are nonzero. Also, if  ~  and ( is nonsingular, then 8 is
unitary/orthogonal.
If the columns of ( are not linearly independent, we can make one final
adjustment to this matrix factorization. If a column " ° is zero, then we may
replace this column by any vector as long as we replace the ²Á ³th entry  in 9
by . Therefore, we can take nonzero columns of 8, extend to an orthonormal
basis for the span of the columns of 8 and replace the zero columns of 8 by the
additional members of this orthonormal basis. In this way, 8 is replaced by a
unitary/orthogonal matrix 8Z and 9 is replaced by an upper triangular matrix 9 Z
that has nonnegative entries on the main diagonal.

Theorem 9.12 Let (  CÁ ²- ³, where - ~ d or - ~ s. There exists a
matrix 8  CÁ ²- ³ with orthonormal columns and an upper triangular
matrix 9  C ²- ³ with nonnegative real entries on the main diagonal for
which
( ~ 89
Moreover, if  ~ , then 8 is unitary/orthogonal. If ( is nonsingular, then 9
can be chosen to have positive entries on the main diagonal, in which case the
factors 8 and 9 are unique. The factorization ( ~ 89 is called the 89
factorization of the matrix (. If ( is real, then 8 and 9 may be taken to be
real.
Proof. As to uniqueness, if ( is nonsingular and 89 ~ 8 9 then
c
8c
 8 ~ 9 9

and the right side is upper triangular with nonzero entries on the main diagonal
and the left side is unitary. But an upper triangular matrix with positive entries
on the main diagonal is unitary if and only if it is the identity and so 8 ~ 8
and 9 ~ 9. Finally, if ( is real, then all computations take place in the real
field and so 8 and 9 are real.
The 89 decomposition has important applications. For example, a system of
linear equations (% ~ " can be written in the form
89% ~ "
and since 8c ~ 8i , we have
9% ~ 8i "
This is an upper triangular system, which is easily solved by back substitution;
that is, starting from the bottom and working up.
We mention also that the 89 factorization is associated with an algorithm for
approximating the eigenvalues of a matrix, called the 89 algorithm.
Specifically, if ( ~ ( is an  d  matrix, define a sequence of matrices as
follows:
1) Let ( ~ 8 9 be the 89 factorization of ( and let ( ~ 9 8 .
2) Once ( has been defined, let ( ~ 8 9 be the 89 factorization of (
and let (b ~ 9 8 .
Then ( is unitarily/orthogonally similar to (, since
i
8c ( 8ic ~ 8c ²9c 8c ³8c

For complex matrices, it can be shown that under certain circumstances, such as
when the eigenvalues of ( have distinct norms, the sequence ( converges

(entrywise) to an upper triangular matrix < , which therefore has the eigenvalues
of ( on its main diagonal. Results can be obtained in the real case as well. For
more details, we refer the reader to [48], page 115.

Hilbert and Hamel Bases
Definition A maximal orthonormal set in an inner product space = is called a
Hilbert basis for = .
Zorn's lemma can be used to show that any nontrivial inner product space has a
Hilbert basis. We leave the details to the reader.
Some care must be taken not to confuse the concepts of a basis for a vector
space and a Hilbert basis for an inner product space. To avoid confusion, a
vector space basis, that is, a maximal linearly independent set of vectors, is
referred to as a Hamel basis. We will refer to an orthonormal Hamel basis as an
orthonormal basis.
To be perfectly clear, there are maximal linearly independent sets called
(Hamel) bases and maximal orthonormal sets (called Hilbert bases). If a
maximal linearly independent set (basis) is orthonormal, it is called an
orthonormal basis.
Moreover, since every orthonormal set is linearly independent, it follows that an
orthonormal basis is a Hilbert basis, since it cannot be properly contained in an
orthonormal set. For finite-dimensional inner product spaces, the two types of
bases are the same.
Theorem 9.13 Let = be an inner product space. A finite subset
E ~ ¸" Á Ã Á " ¹ of = is an orthonormal (Hamel) basis for = if and only if it is
a Hilbert basis for = .
Proof. We have seen that any orthonormal basis is a Hilbert basis. Conversely,
if E is a finite maximal orthonormal set and E  F , where F is linearly
independent, then we may apply part 1) to extend E to a strictly larger
orthonormal set, in contradiction to the maximality of E . Hence, E is maximal
linearly independent.
The following example shows that the previous theorem fails for infinitedimensional inner product spaces.
Example 9.5 Let = ~ M and let 4 be the set of all vectors of the form
 ~ ²Á Ã Á Á Á Á Ã ³
where  has a  in the th coordinate and 's elsewhere. Clearly, 4 is an
orthonormal set. Moreover, it is maximal. For if # ~ ²% ³  M has the property
that #  4 , then

Real and Complex Inner Product Spaces

219

% ~ º#Á  » ~ 
for all  and so # ~ . Hence, no nonzero vector # ¤ 4 is orthogonal to 4 .
This shows that 4 is a Hilbert basis for the inner product space M .
On the other hand, the vector space span of 4 is the subspace : of all
sequences in M that have finite support, that is, have only a finite number of
nonzero terms and since span²4 ³ ~ : £ M , we see that 4 is not a Hamel
basis for the vector space M .

The Projection Theorem and Best Approximations
Orthonormal bases have a great practical advantage over arbitrary bases. From a
computational point of view, if 8 ~ ¸# Á Ã Á # ¹ is a basis for = , then each
#  = has the form
# ~  # b Ä b  #
In general, determining the coordinates  requires solving a system of linear
equations of size  d .
On the other hand, if E ~ ¸" Á Ã Á " ¹ is an orthonormal basis for = and
# ~  "  b Ä b   " 
then the coefficients  are quite easily computed:
º#Á " » ~ º " b Ä b  " Á " » ~  º" Á " » ~ 
Even if E ~ ¸" Á Ã Á " ¹ is not a basis (but just an orthonormal set), we can
still consider the expansion
V# ~ º#Á " »" b Ä b º#Á " »"
Theorem 9.14 Let E ~ ¸" Á Ã Á " ¹ be an orthonormal subset of an inner
product space = and let : ~ ºE». The Fourier expansion with respect to E of
a vector #  = is
V# ~ º#Á " »" b Ä b º#Á " »"
Each coefficient º#Á " » is called a Fourier coefficient of # with respect to E .
The vector V# can be characterized as follows:
1) V# is the unique vector  : for which ²# c ³  : .
2) V# is the best approximation to # from within : , that is, V# is the unique
vector  : that is closest to #, in the sense that

)# c ) ~ )# c V# b V# c ) ~ )# c V#) b )V# c )
Hence, )# c ) is smallest if and only if ~ V# and the smallest value is
)# c V#). We leave proof of Bessel's inequality as an exercise.
Theorem 9.15 (The projection theorem) If : is a finite-dimensional subspace
of an inner product space = , then
: ~ : p :
In particular, if #  = , then
# ~ V# b ²# c V#³  : p : 
It follows that

Proof. We have seen that # c V#  :  and so = ~ : b :  . But : q :  ~ ¸¹
and so = ~ : p :  .
The following example shows that the projection theorem may fail if : is not
finite-dimensional. Indeed, in the infinite-dimensional case, : must be a
complete subspace, but we postpone a discussion of this case until Chapter 13.
Example 9.6 As in Example 9.5, let = ~ M and let : be the subspace of all
sequences with finite support, that is, : is spanned by the vectors
 ~ ²Á Ã Á Á Á Á Ã ³

the projection theorem implies that # ~ b Z where  : and Z  :  . Then
Z

Characterizing Orthonormal Bases
We can characterize orthonormal bases using Fourier expansions.
Theorem 9.17 Let E ~ ¸" Á Ã Á " ¹ be an orthonormal subset of an inner
product space = and let : ~ ºE». The following are equivalent:
1) E is an orthonormal basis for = .
2) ºE» ~ ¸¹
3) Every vector is equal to its Fourier expansion, that is, for all #  = ,
V# ~ #
4) Bessel's identity holds for all #  = , that is,

VE
where
´#µE h ´$µ
V
V E ~ º#Á " »º$Á " » b Ä b º#Á " »º$Á " »
is the standard dot product in -  .
Proof. To see that 1) implies 2), if #  ºE» is nonzero, then E r ¸#°)#)¹ is
orthonormal and so E is not maximal. Conversely, if E is not maximal, there is
an orthonormal set F for which E  F . Then any nonzero #  F ± E is in
ºE» . Hence, 2) implies 1). We leave the rest of the proof as an exercise.

The Riesz Representation Theorem
We have been dealing with linear maps for some time. We now have a need for
conjugate linear maps.
Definition A function ¢ = ¦ > on complex vector spaces is conjugate linear
if it is additive,

for all   d. A conjugate isomorphism is a bijective conjugate linear map.
If %  = , then the inner product function º h Á %»¢ = ¦ - defined by
º h Á %»# ~ º#Á %»
is a linear functional on = . Thus, the linear map  ¢ = ¦ = i defined by
% ~ º h Á %»
is conjugate linear. Moreover, since º h Á %» ~ º h Á &» implies % ~ &, it follows
that  is injective and therefore a conjugate isomorphism (since = is finitedimensional).
Theorem 9.18 (The Riesz representation theorem) Let = be a finitedimensional inner product space.
1) The map ¢ = ¦ = i defined by
% ~ º h Á %»
is a conjugate isomorphism. In particular, for each   = i , there exists a

2) The map 9¢ = i ¦ = defined by

Proof. Here is the usual proof that  is surjective. If  ~ , then 9 ~ , so let

Throughout this chapter, all vector spaces are assumed to be finite-dimensional
unless otherwise noted. Also, the field - is either s or d.

The Adjoint of a Linear Operator
The purpose of this chapter is to study the structure of certain special types of
linear operators on finite-dimensional real and complex inner product spaces. In
order to define these operators, we introduce another type of adjoint (different
from the operator adjoint of Chapter 3).
Theorem 10.1 Let = and > be finite-dimensional inner product spaces over and let   B²= Á > ³. Then there is a unique function  i ¢ > ¦ = , defined by
the condition
º #Á $» ~ º#Á  i $»
for all #  = and $  > . This function is in B²> Á = ³ and is called the adjoint
of  .
Proof. If  i exists, then it is unique, for if
º #Á $» ~ º#Á $»
then º#Á $» ~ º#Á  i $» for all # and $ and so  ~  i .
We seek a linear map  i ¢ > ¦ = for which
º#Á  i $» ~ º #Á $»
By way of motivation, the vector  i $, if it exists, looks very much like a linear
map sending # to º #Á $». The only problem is that  i # is supposed to be a
vector, not a linear map. But the Riesz representation theorem tells us that linear
maps can be represented by vectors.

Advanced Linear Algebra

Specifically, for each $  > , the linear functional $  = i defined by
$ # ~ º #Á $»
has the form
$ # ~ º#Á 9$ »
where 9$  = is the Riesz vector for $ . If  i ¢ > ¦ = is defined by
 i $ ~ 9$ ~ 9²$ ³
where 9 is the Riesz map, then
º#Á  i $» ~ º#Á 9$ » ~ $ # ~ º #Á $»
Finally, since  i ~ 9 k  is the composition of the Riesz map 9 and the map
 ¢ $ ª $ and since both of these maps are conjugate linear, their composition
is linear.
Here are some of the basic properties of the adjoint.
Theorem 10.2 Let = and > be finite-dimensional inner product spaces. For
every Á   B²= Á > ³ and   - ,
1) ² b  ³i ~ i b  i
2) ² ³i ~  i
3)  ii ~  and so
º i #Á $» ~ º#Á  $»
4) If = ~ > , then ² ³i ~  i i
5) If  is invertible, then ² c ³i ~ ² i ³c
6) If = ~ > and ²%³  s´%µ, then ² ³i ~ ² i ³.
Moreover, if   B²= ³ and : is a subspace of = , then
7) : is  -invariant if and only if :  is  i -invariant.
8) ²:Á :  ³ reduces  if and only if : is both  -invariant and  i -invariant, in
which case
² O: ³i ~ ² i ³O:
Proof. For part 7), let  : and '  :  and write
º i 'Á » ~ º'Á  »
Now, if : is  -invariant, then º i 'Á » ~  for all  : and so  i '  :  and
:  is  i -invariant. Conversely, if :  is  i -invariant, then º'Á  » ~  for all
'  :  and so   :  ~ : , whence : is  -invariant.
The first statement in part 8) follows from part 7) applied to both : and :  . For
the second statement, since : is both  -invariant and  i -invariant, if Á !  : ,

then
º Á ² i ³O: ²!³» ~ º Á  i !» ~ º Á !» ~ º O: ² ³Á !»
Hence, by definition of adjoint, ² i ³O: ~ ² O: ³i .
Now let us relate the kernel and image of a linear transformation to those of its
adjoint.
Theorem 10.3 Let   B²= Á > ³, where = and > are finite-dimensional inner
product spaces.
1)
ker² i ³ ~ im² ³

im² i ³ ~ im² ³

and so

4)
²:Á; ³i ~ ;  Á: 

"  ker² i ³ ¯  i " ~ 
¯ º i "Á = » ~ ¸¹
¯ º"Á  = » ~ ¸¹
¯ "  im² ³
and so ker² i ³ ~ im² ³ . The second equation in part 1) follows by replacing 
by  i and taking complements.
For part 2), it is clear that ker² ³  ker² i  ³. For the reverse inclusion, we have
 i " ~ 

¬

º i  "Á "» ~ 

¬

º "Á  "» ~ 

¬

" ~ 

and so ker² i  ³  ker² ³. The second equation follows from the first by
replacing  with  i . We leave the rest of the proof for the reader.

The Operator Adjoint and the Hilbert Space Adjoint
We should make some remarks about the relationship between the operator
adjoint  d of  , as defined in Chapter 3 and the adjoint  i that we have just
defined, which is sometimes called the Hilbert space adjoint. In the first place,
if  ¢ = ¦ > , then  d and  i have different domains and ranges:
 d¢ > i ¦ = i

and

 i¢ > ¦ =

The two maps are shown in Figure 10.1, along with the conjugate Riesz
isomorphisms 9 = ¢ = i ¦ = and 9 > ¢ > i ¦ > .

The composite map ¢ > ¦ = defined by
 ~ ²9 = ³c k  i k 9 >
is linear. Moreover, for all   > i and #  = ,
² d ² ³³# ~  ² #³
~ º #Á 9 > ² ³»
~ º#Á  i 9 > ² ³»
~ ´²9 = ³c ² i 9 > ² ³³µ²#³
~ ² ³#
and so  ~  d . Hence, the relationship between  d and  i is
 d ~ ²9 = ³c k  i k 9 >
Loosely speaking, the Riesz functions are like “change of variables” functions
from linear functionals to vectors, and we can say that  i does to Riesz vectors
what  d does to the corresponding linear functionals. Put another way (and just
as loosely),  and  i are the same, up to conjugate Riesz isomorphism.
In Chapter 3, we showed that the matrix of the operator adjoint  d is the
transpose of the matrix of the map  . For Hilbert space adjoints, the situation is
slightly different (due to the conjugate linearity of the inner product). Suppose
that 8 ~ ² Á Ã Á  ³ and 9 ~ ² Á Ã Á  ³ are ordered orthonormal bases for =
and > , respectively. Then

²´ i µ9Á8 ³Á ~ º i  Á  » ~ º Á   » ~ º  Á  » ~ ²´ µ8Á9 ³Á
and so ´ i µ9Á8 and ´ µ8Á9 are conjugate transposes. The conjugate transpose of a
matrix ( ~ ²Á ³ is
(i ~ ²Á ³!
and is called the adjoint of (.
Theorem 10.4 Let   B²= Á > ³, where = and > are finite-dimensional inner
product spaces.
1) The operator adjoint  d and the Hilbert space adjoint  i are related by
 d ~ ²9 = ³c k  i k 9 >
where 9 = and 9 > are the conjugate Riesz isomorphisms on = and > ,
respectively.
2) If 8 and 9 are ordered orthonormal bases for = and > , respectively, then
´ i µ9Á8 ~ ²´ µ8Á9 ³i
In words, the matrix of the adjoint  i is the adjoint (conjugate transpose) of
the matrix of  .

Orthogonal Projections
In an inner product space, we can single out some special projection operators.
Definition A projection of the form :Á:  is said to be orthogonal.
Equivalently, a projection  is orthogonal if ker²³  im²³.
Some care must be taken to avoid confusion between orthogonal projections and
two projections that are orthogonal to each other, that is, for which
 ~  ~ .
We have seen that an operator  is a projection operator if and only if it is
idempotent. Here is the analogous characterization of orthogonal projections.
Theorem 10.5 Let = be a finite-dimensional inner product space. The following
are equivalent for an operator  on = :
1)  is an orthogonal projection
2)  is idempotent and self-adjoint
3)  is idempotent and does not expand lengths, that is
)#)  )#)
for all #  = .
