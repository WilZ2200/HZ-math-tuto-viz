Ideals and Quotients
In defining the notion of an ideal of an algebra (, we must consider the fact that
( may be noncommutative.
Definition A (two-sided) ideal of an associative algebra ( is a nonempty
subset 0 of ( that is closed under addition and subtraction, that is,
Á   0

 b Á  c   0

and also left and right multiplication by elements of (, that is,

The ideal generated by a nonempty subset ? of ( is the smallest ideal

Definition An algebra ( is simple if
1) The product in ( is not trivial, that is,  £  for at least one pair of
elements Á   (
2) ( has no proper nonzero ideals.
Definition If 0 is an ideal in (, then the quotient algebra is the quotient

Homomorphisms
Definition If ( and ) are - -algebras a map ¢ ( ¦ ) is an algebra
homomorphism if it is a ring homomorphism as well as a linear
transformation, that is,

The usual terms monomorphism, epimorphism, isomorphism, embedding,
endomorphism and automorphism apply to algebras with the analogous meaning
as for vector spaces and modules.
Example 18.6 Let = be an -dimensional vector space over - . Fix an ordered
basis 8 for = . Consider the map ¢ B²= ³ ¦ C ²- ³ defined by
²³ ~ ´µ8
where ´µ8 is the matrix representation of  with respect to the ordered basis 8 .
This map is a vector space isomorphism and since
´µ8 ~ ´ µ8 ´µ8
it is also an algebra isomorphism.

Another View of Algebras
If ( is an algebra over - , then ( contains a copy of - . Specifically, we define a
function ¢ - ¦ ( by
 ~ 
for all   - , where   ( is the multiplicative identity. The elements  are in
the center of (, since for any   (,
²³ ~ ²³ ~ 
and
²³ ~ ²³ ~ 
Thus, ¢ - ¦ A²(³. To see that  is a ring homomorphism, we have
²- ³ ~ - h  ~ 
² b ³ ~ ² b ³ ~  b  ~ ²³ b ² ³
² ³ ~ ² ³ ~ ² ³ ~ ² ³ ~ ² h ² ³³ ~ ² h ³² ³ ~ ²³² ³
Moreover, if  ~  and  £ , then
 ~ c ²³ ~ - h  ~ 
and so provided that  £  in (, we have  ~ . Thus,  is an embedding.
Theorem 18.1
1) If ( is an associative algebra over - and if  £  in (, then the map
¢ - ¦ A²(³ defined by
 ~ 
is an embedding of the field - into the center A²(³ of the ring (. Thus, can be embedded as a subring of A²(³.

2) Conversely, if 9 is a ring with identity and if -  A²9³ is a field, then 9
is an - -algebra with scalar multiplication defined by the product in 9 .
One interesting consequence of this theorem is that a ring 9 whose center does
not contain a field is not an algebra over any field - . This happens, for example,
with the ring { .

The Regular Representation of an Algebra
An algebra homomorphism ¢ ( ¦ B- ²= ³ is called a representation of the
algebra ( in B- ²= ³. A representation  is faithful if it is injective, that is, if 
is an embedding. In this case, ( is isomorphic to a subalgebra of B- ²= ³.
Actually, the endomorphism algebras B- ²= ³ are the most general algebras
possible, in the sense that any algebra ( has a faithful representation in some
endomorphism algebra.
Theorem 18.2 Any associative - -algebra ( is isomorphic to a subalgebra of
the endomorphism algebra B- ²(³. In fact, if  is the left multiplication map
defined by
 % ~ %
then the map ¢ ( ¦ B ²(³ is an algebra embedding, called the left regular
representation of (.
When dim²(³ ~   B, we can select an ordered basis 8 for ( and represent
the elements of B- ²(³ by matrices. This gives an embedding of ( into the
matrix algebra C ²- ³, called the left regular matrix representation of (
with respect to the ordered basis 8 .
Example 18.7 Let . ~ ¸Á Á Ã Á c ¹ be a finite cyclic group. Let
8 ~ ²Á Á Ã Á c ³
be an ordered basis for the group algebra - ´.µ. The multiplication map  that
is multiplcation by  is a shifting of 8 (with wraparound) and so the matrix
representation of  is the matrix whose columns are obtained from the identity
matrix by shifting  columns to the right (with wrap around). For example,

Since the endomorphism algebras B- ²= ³ are of obvious importance, let us
examine them a bit more closely.
Theorem 18.3 Let = be a vector space over a field - .
1) The algebra B- ²= ³ has center
A ~ ¸    - ¹
and so B- ²= ³ is central.
2) The set 0 of all elements of B- ²= ³ that have finite rank is an ideal of
B- ²= ³ and is contained in all other ideals of B- ²= ³.
3) B- ²= ³ is simple if and only if = is finite-dimensional.
Proof. We leave the proof of parts 1) and 3) as exercises. For part 2), we leave
it to the reader to show that 0 is an ideal of B- ²= ³. Let 1 be a nonzero ideal of
B- ²= ³. Let   B- ²= ³ have rank . Then there is a basis 8 ~ 8 r 8 (a
disjoint union) and a nonzero $  = for which 8 is a finite set,  ²8 ³ ~ ¸¹
and  ²³ ~  $ for all   8 . Thus,  is a linear combination over - of
endomorphisms  defined by
 ²³ ~ $Á

 ²8 ± ¸¹³ ~ ¸¹

Hence, we need only show that   1 .
If   1 is nonzero, then there is an   8 for which  ~ " £ . If   B- ²= ³
is defined by
  ~ Á

 ²8 ± ¸¹³ ~ ¸¹

and   B- ²= ³ is defined by
" ~ $Á

²8 ± ¸"¹³ ~ ¸¹

then
 ²³ ~ $Á

 ²8 ± ¸¹³ ~ ¸¹

and so  ~   1 .

Annihilators and Minimal Polynomials
If ( is an - -algebra an   (, then it may happen that  satisfies a nonzero
polynomial ²%³  - ´%µ. This always happens, in particular, if ( is finitedimensional, since in this case the powers
Á Á  Á Ã
must be linearly dependent and so there is a nonzero polynomial in  that is
equal to .
Definition Let ( be an - -algebra. An element   ( is algebraic if there is a
nonzero polynomial ²%³  - ´%µ for which ²³ ~ . If  is algebraic, the

monic polynomial  ²%³ of smallest degree that is satisfied by  is called the
minimal polynomial of .
If   ( is algebraic over - , then the subalgebra generated by  over - is
- ´µ ~ ¸²³  ²%³  - ´%µÁ deg²³  deg² ³¹
and this is isomorphic to the quotient algebra
- ´µ 

- ´%µ
º ²%³»

where º ²%³» is the ideal generated by the minimal polynomial of . We leave
the details of this as an exercise.
The minimal polynomial can be used to tell when an element is invertible.
Theorem 18.4
1) The minimal polynomial  ²%³ of   ( generates the annihilator of ,
that is, the ideal
ann²³ ~ ¸ ²%³  - ´%µ   ²³ ~ ¹
of all polynomials that annihilate .
2) The element   ( is invertible if and only if  ²%³ has nonzero constant
term.
Proof. We prove only the second statement. If  is invertible but
 ²%³ ~ %²%³
then  ~  ²³ ~ ²³. Multiplying by c gives ²³ ~ , which contradicts
the minimality of deg² ²%³³. Conversely, if
 ²%³ ~  b  % b Ä b c %c b %

Theorem 18.5 If ( is a finite-dimensional - -algebra, then every element of (
is algebraic. There are infinite-dimensional algebras in which all elements are
algebraic.
Proof. The first statement has been proved. To prove the second, let us consider
the complex field d as a r-algebra. The set ( of algebraic elements of d is a
field, known as the field of algebraic numbers. These are the complex numbers
that are roots of some nonzero polynomial with rational (or integral)
coefficients.
To see this, if   (, then the subalgebra r´µ is finite-dimensional. Also, r´µ
is a field. To prove this, first note that since d is a field, the minimal polynomial
of any nonzero   ( is irreducible, for if  ²%³ ~ ²%³²%³, then
 ~ ²³²³ and so one of ²³ and ²³ is , which implies that
²%³ ~  ²%³ or ²%³ ~  ²%³. Since  ²%³ is irreducible, it has nonzero
constant term and so the inverse of  is a polynomial in , that is, c  r´µ.
Of course, r´µ is closed under addition and multiplication and so r´µ is a
subfield of d.
Thus, d is an algebra over r´µ. By similar reasoning, if   (, then the
minimal polynomial of  over r´µ is irreducible and so  c  r´µ´µ. Since
r´µ´µ ~ r´Á µ is the set of all polynomials in the “variables”  and  , it is
closed under addition and multiplication as well. Hence, r´Á µ is a finitedimensional algebra over r´µ, as well as a subfield of d. Now,
dimr ²r´Á µ³ ~ dimr´µ ²r´Á µ³ h dimr ²r´µ³
and so r´Á µ is finite-dimensional over r. Hence, the elements of r´Á µ are
algebraic over r, that is, r´Á µ  (. But r´Á µ contains c Á  b Á  c  and
 and so ( is a field.
We claim that ( is not finite-dimensional over r. This follows from the fact
that for every prime , the polynomial % c  is irreducible over r (by
Eisenstein's criterion). Hence, if  is a complex root of % c , then  has
minimal polynomial % c  over r and so the dimension of r´µ over r is .
Hence, ( cannot be finite-dimensional.

The Spectrum of an Element
Let ( be an algebra. A nonzero element   ( is a left zero divisor if  ~ 
for some  £  and a right zero divisor if  ~  for some  £ . In the
exercises, we ask the reader to show that an algebraic element is a left zero
divisor if and only if it is a right zero divisor.
Theorem 18.6 Let ( be a algebra. An algebraic element   ( is invertible if
and only if it is not a zero divisor.
Proof. If  is invertible and  ~ , then multiplying by c gives  ~ .
Conversely, suppose that  is not invertible but  ~  implies  ~ . Then

 ²%³ ~ %²%³ for some nonzero polynomial ²%³ and so  ~ ²³, which
implies that ²³ ~ , a contradiction to the minimality of  ²%³.
We have seen that the eigenvalues of a linear operator  on a finite-dimensional
vector space are the roots of the minimal polynomial of  , or equivalently, the
scalars  for which  c  is not invertible. By analogy, we can define the
eigenvalues of an element  of an algebra (.
Theorem 18.7 Let ( be an algebra and let   ( be algebraic. An element
  - is a root of the minimal polynomial  ²%³ if and only if  c  is not
invertible in (.
Proof. If  c  is not invertible, then
c ²%³ ~ %²%³
and since  ²% b ³ is satisfied by  c , it follows that
%²%³ ~ c ²%³   ²% b ³
Hence, ²% c ³   ²%³. Alternatively, if  c  is not invertible, then there is
a nonzero   ( such that ² c ³ ~ , that is,  ~  . Hence, for any
polynomial ²%³ we have ²³ ~ ²³ . Setting ²%³ ~  ²%³ gives
 ²³ ~ .
Conversely, if  ²³ ~ , then  ²%³ ~ ²% c ³²%³ and so
 ~ ² c ³²³, which shows that  c  is a zero divisor and therefore not
invertible.
Definition Let A be an - -algebra and let   ( be algebraic. The roots of the
minimal polynomial of  are called the eigenvalues of . The set of all
eigenvalues of 
Spec²³ ~ ¸  -   ²³ ~ ¹
is called the spectrum of .
Note that   ( is invertible if and only if  ¤ Spec²³.
Theorem 18.8 (The spectral mapping theorem) Let ( be an algebra over an
algebraically closed field - . Let   ( and let ²%³  - ´%µ. Then
Spec²²³³ ~ ²Spec²³³ ~ ¸²³    Spec²³¹
Proof. We leave it as an exercise to show that ²Spec²³³  Spec²²³³. For
the reverse inclusion, let   Spec²²³³ and suppose that
²%³ c  ~ ²% c  ³ Ä²% c  ³
Then

²³ c  ~ ² c  ³ Ä² c  ³

² ³ c  ~ 
and so  ~ ² ³  ²Spec²³³. Hence, Spec²²³³  ²Spec²³³.
Theorem 18.9 Let ( be an algebra over an algebraically closed field - . If
Á   (, then
Spec²³ ~ Spec²³
Proof. If  £  ¤ Spec²³, then  c  is invertible and a simple computation
gives
² c ³´² c ³c  c µ ~ 
and so  c  is invertible and  ¤ Spec²³. If  ¤ Spec²³, then  is
invertible. We leave it as an exercise to show that this implies that  is also
invertible and so  ¤ Spec²³. Thus, Spec²³  Spec²³ and by symmetry,
equality must hold.

Division Algebras
Some important associative algebras ( have the property that all nonzero
elements are invertible and yet ( is not a field since it is not commutative.
Definition An associative algebra + over a field - is a division algebra if
every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.
Our goal in this section is to classify all finite-dimensional division algebras
over the real field s, over any algebraically closed field - and over any finite
field. The classification of finite-dimensional division algebras over the rational
field r is quite complicated and we will not treat it here.

The Quaternions
Perhaps the most famous noncommutative division algebra is the following.
Define a real vector space i with basis
