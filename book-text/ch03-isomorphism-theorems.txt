Figure 3.1: The correspondence theorem
Theorem 3.3 (The correspondence theorem) Let : be a subspace of = . Then
the function that assigns to each intermediate subspace :  ;  = the
subspace ; °: of = °: is an order-preserving (with respect to set inclusion)
one-to-one correspondence between the set of all subspaces of = containing :
and the set of all subspaces of = °: .
Proof. We prove only that the correspondence is surjective. Let
? ~ ¸" b :  "  < ¹
be a subspace of = °: and let ; be the union of all cosets in ? :
; ~  ²" b :³
"<

We show that :  ;  = and that ; °: ~ ? . If %Á &  ; , then % b : and
& b : are in ? and since ?  = °: , we have
% b :Á ²% b &³ b :  ?
which implies that %Á % b &  ; . Hence, ; is a subspace of = containing : .
Moreover, if ! b :  ; °: , then !  ; and so ! b :  ? . Conversely, if
" b :  ? , then "  ; and therefore " b :  ; °: . Thus, ? ~ ; °: .

Figure 3.2: The universal property
The universal property states that if ker² ³  : , then there is a unique
 Z ¢ = °: ¦ > for which
 Z k : ~ 
Another way to say this is that any such   B²= Á > ³ can be factored through
the canonical projection : .
Theorem 3.4 Let : be a subspace of = and let   B²= Á > ³ satisfy
:  ker² ³. Then, as pictured in Figure 3.2, there is a unique linear
transformation  Z ¢ = °: ¦ > with the property that
 Z k : ~ 
Moreover, ker² Z ³ ~ ker² ³°: and im² Z ³ ~ im² ³.
Proof. We have no other choice but to define  Z by the condition  Z k : ~  ,
that is,
 Z ²# b :³ ~  #
This function is well-defined if and only if
# b : ~ " b : ¬  Z ²# b :³ ~  Z ²" b :³
which is equivalent to each of the following statements:
# b : ~ " b : ¬ # ~ "
# c "  : ¬  ²# c "³ ~ 

Thus,  Z ¢ = °: ¦ > is well-defined. Also,

The uniqueness of  Z is evident.
Theorem 3.4 has a very important corollary, which is often called the first
isomorphism theorem and is obtained by taking : ~ ker² ³.
Theorem 3.5 (The first isomorphism theorem) Let ¢ = ¦ > be a linear
transformation. Then the linear transformation  Z ¢ = °ker² ³ ¦ > defined by

According to Theorem 3.5, the image of any linear transformation on = is
isomorphic to a quotient space of = . Conversely, any quotient space = °: of =
is the image of a linear transformation on = : the canonical projection : . Thus,
up to isomorphism, quotient spaces are equivalent to homomorphic images.

Quotient Spaces, Complements and Codimension
The first isomorphism theorem gives some insight into the relationship between
complements and quotient spaces. Let : be a subspace of = and let ; be a
complement of : , that is,
= ~: l;
Applying the first isomorphism theorem to the projection operator ; Á: ¢ = ¦ ;
gives
;  = °:
Theorem 3.6 Let : be a subspace of = . All complements of : in = are
isomorphic to = °: and hence to each other.
The previous theorem can be rephrased by writing
(l) ~(l* ¬) *
On the other hand, quotients and complements do not behave as nicely with
respect to isomorphisms as one might casually think. We leave it to the reader to
show the following:

The Isomorphism Theorems

1) It is possible that
(l) ~* l+
° +. Hence, (  * does not imply that a complement
with (  * but ) 
of ( is isomorphic to a complement of * .
2) It is possible that =  > and
= ~ : l ) and > ~ : l +
but ) °
 +. Hence, =  > does not imply that = °:  > °: . (However,
according to the previous theorem, if = equals > then )  +.)
Corollary 3.7 Let : be a subspace of a vector space = . Then
dim²= ³ ~ dim²:³ b dim²= °:³
Definition If : is a subspace of = , then dim²= °:³ is called the codimension of
: in = and is denoted by codim²:³ or codim= ²:³.
Thus, the codimension of : in = is the dimension of any complement of : in =
and when = is finite-dimensional, we have
codim= ²:³ ~ dim²= ³ c dim²:³
(This makes no sense, in general, if = is not finite-dimensional, since infinite
cardinal numbers cannot be subtracted.)

Additional Isomorphism Theorems
There are other isomorphism theorems that are direct consequences of the first
isomorphism theorem. As we have seen, if = ~ : l ; then = °;  : . This can
be written
: l;
:


: q;
This applies to nondirect sums as well.
Theorem 3.7 (The second isomorphism theorem) Let = be a vector space
and let : and ; be subspaces of = . Then
: b;


;
: q;
Proof. Let ¢ ²: b ; ³ ¦ :°²: q ; ³ be defined by
² b !³ ~ b ²: q ; ³
We leave it to the reader to show that  is a well-defined surjective linear
transformation, with kernel ; . An application of the first isomorphism theorem
then completes the proof.

Linear Functionals
Linear transformations from = to the base field - (thought of as a vector space
over itself) are extremely important.
Definition Let = be a vector space over - . A linear transformation
  B²= Á - ³ whose values lie in the base field - is called a linear functional
(or simply functional) on = . (Some authors use the term linear function.) The
vector space of all linear functionals on = is denoted by = * and is called the
algebraic dual space of = .
The adjective algebraic is needed here, since there is another type of dual space
that is defined on general normed vector spaces, where continuity of linear
transformations makes sense. We will discuss the so-called continuous dual
space briefly in Chapter 13. However, until then, the term “dual space” will
refer to the algebraic dual space.

The Isomorphism Theorems

95

To help distinguish linear functionals from other types of linear transformations,
we will usually denote linear functionals by lowercase italic letters, such as  , 
and .
Example 3.1 The map  ¢ - ´%µ ¦ - defined by  ²²%³³ ~ ²³ is a linear
functional, known as evaluation at .
Example 3.2 Let 9´Á µ denote the vector space of all continuous functions on
´Á µ  s. Let  ¢ 9´Á µ ¦ s be defined by


 ²²%³³ ~

²%³ %


Then   9´Á µi .
For any   = * , the rank plus nullity theorem is
dim²ker² ³³ b dim²im² ³³ ~ dim²= ³
But since im² ³  - , we have either im² ³ ~ ¸¹, in which case  is the zero
linear functional, or im² ³ ~ - , in which case  is surjective. In other words, a
nonzero linear functional is surjective. Moreover, if  £ , then
codim²ker² ³³ ~ dim6

=
7~
ker² ³

and if dim²= ³  B, then
dim²ker² ³³ ~ dim²= ³ c 
Thus, in dimensional terms, the kernel of a linear functional is a very “large”
subspace of the domain = .
The following theorem will prove very useful.
Theorem 3.10
1) For any nonzero vector #  = , there exists a linear functional   = * for
which  ²#³ £ .
2) A vector #  = is zero if and only if  ²#³ ~  for all   = * .
3) Let   = i . If  ²%³ £ , then
= ~ º%» l ker² ³
4) Two nonzero linear functionals  Á   = i have the same kernel if and only
if there is a nonzero scalar  such that  ~ .
Proof. For part 3), if  £ #  º%» q ker² ³, then  ²#³ ~  and # ~ % for
 £   - , whence  ²%³ ~ , which is false. Hence, º%» q ker² ³ ~ ¸¹ and
the direct sum : ~ º%» l ker² ³ exists. Also, for any #  = we have

and so = ~ º%» l ker² ³.
For part 4), if  ~  for  £ , then ker² ³ ~ ker²³. Conversely, if
2 ~ ker² ³ ~ ker²³, then for % ¤ 2 we have by part 3),
= ~ º%» l 2
Of course,  O2 ~ O2 for any . Therefore, if  ~  ²%³°²%³, it follows that
²%³ ~  ²%³ and hence  ~ .

Dual Bases
Let = be a vector space with basis 8 ~ ¸#    0¹. For each   0 , we can
define a linear functional #i  = * by the orthogonality condition
#i ²# ³ ~ Á
where Á is the Kronecker delta function, defined by
Á ~ F

if  ~ 
if  £ 




Then the set 8 i ~ ¸#i    0¹ is linearly independent, since applying the
equation

to the basis vector # gives

for all  .
Theorem 3.11 Let = be a vector space with basis 8 ~ ¸#    0¹.
1) The set 8 i ~ ¸#i    0¹ is linearly independent.
2) If = is finite-dimensional, then 8 i is a basis for = i , called the dual basis of
8.
Proof. For part 2), for any   = i , we have
  ²# ³#i ²# ³ ~   ²# ³Á ~  ²# ³




and so  ~   ²# ³#i is in the span of 8 i . Hence, 8 * is a basis for = i .

The Isomorphism Theorems

It follows from the previous theorem that if dim²= ³  B, then
dim²= i ³ ~ dim²= ³
since the dual vectors also form a basis for = i . Our goal now is to show that the
converse of this also holds. But first, let us consider an example.
Example 3.3 Let = be an infinite-dimensional vector space over the field
- ~ { ~ ¸Á ¹, with basis 8 . Since the only coefficients in - are  and , a
finite linear combination over - is just a finite sum. Hence, = is the set of all
finite sums of vectors in 8 and so according to Theorem 0.12,
(= (  (F ²8 ³( ~ (8 (
On the other hand, each linear functional   = i is uniquely defined by
specifying its values on the basis 8 . Since these values must be either  or ,
specifying a linear functional is equivalent to specifying the subset of 8 on
which  takes the value . In other words, there is a one-to-one correspondence
between linear functionals on = and all subsets of 8 . Hence,
(= i ( ~ (F ²8 ³(  (8 (  (= (
This shows that = i cannot be isomorphic to = , nor to any proper subset of = .
Hence, dim²= i ³  dim²= ³.
We wish to show that the behavior in the previous example is typical, in
particular, that
dim²= ³  dim²= i ³
with equality if and only if = is finite-dimensional. The proof uses the concept
of the prime subfield of a field 2 , which is defined as the smallest subfield of
the field 2 . Since Á   2 , it follows that 2 contains a copy of the integers
Á Á  ~  b Á  ~  b  b Á Ã
If 2 has prime characteristic , then  ~  and so 2 contains the elements
{ ~ ¸Á Á Á Á Ã Á  c ¹
which form a subfield of 2 . Since any subfield - of 2 contains  and , we see
that {  - and so { is the prime subfield of 2 . On the other hand, if 2 has
characteristic , then 2 contains a “copy” of the integers { and therefore also
the rational numbers r, which is the prime subfield of 2 . Our main interest in
the prime subfield is that in either case, the prime subfield is countable.
Theorem 3.12 Let = be a vector space. Then
dim²= ³  dim²= i ³
with equality if and only if = is finite-dimensional.

98

Advanced Linear Algebra

Proof. For any vector space = , we have
dim²= ³  dim²= i ³
since the dual vectors to a basis 8 for = are linearly independent in = i . We
have already seen that if = is finite-dimensional, then dim²= ³ ~ dim²= i ³. We
wish to show that if = is infinite-dimensional, then dim²= ³  dim²= i ³. (The
author is indebted to Professor Richard Foote for suggesting this line of proof.)
If 8 is a basis for = and if 2 is the base field for = , then Theorem 2.7 implies
that
=  ²2 8 ³
where ²2 8 ³ is the set of all functions with finite support from 8 to 2 and
= i  28
where 2 8 is the set of all functions from 8 to 2 . Thus, we can work with the
vector spaces ²2 8 ³ and 2 8 .
The plan is to show that if - is a countable subfield of 2 and if 8 is infinite,
then
dim2 2²2 8 ³ 3 ~ dim- 2²- 8 ³ 3  dim- ²- 8 ³  dim2 22 8 3
Since we may take - to be the prime subfield of 2 , this will prove the theorem.
The first equality follows from the fact that the 2 -space ²2 8 ³ and the - -space
²- 8 ³ each have a basis consisting of the “standard” linear functionals
¸    8 ¹ defined by
 # ~ Á
for all #  8 , where Á is the Kronecker delta function.
For the final inequality, suppose that ¸ ¹  - 8 is linearly independent over and that
   ~ 


where   2 . If ¸ ¹ is a basis for 2 over - , then  ~  Á  for Á  and so
 ~    ~   Á  


Evaluating at any #  8 gives



and since the inner sums are in - and ¸ ¹ is - -independent, the inner sums
must be zero:
 Á  ²#³ ~ 


Since this holds for all #  8 , we have
 Á  ~ 


which implies that Á ~  for all Á . Hence, ¸ ¹ is linearly independent over
2 . This proves that dim- ²- 8 ³  dim2 22 8 3.
For the center inequality, it is clear that
dim- 2²- 8 ³ 3  dim- ²- 8 ³
We will show that the inequality must be strict by showing that the cardinality
of ²- 8 ³ is (8 ( whereas the cardinality of - 8 is greater than (8 (. To this end, the
set ²- 8 ³ can be partitioned into blocks based on the support of the function. In
particular, for each finite subset : of 8 , if we let

As to the cardinality of - 8 , for each subset ; of 8 , there is a function ;  - 8

and completes the proof.

Reflexivity
If = is a vector space, then so is the dual space = i and so we may form the
double (algebraic) dual space = ii , which consists of all linear functionals
¢ = i ¦ - . In other words, an element  of = ** is a linear functional that
assigns a scalar to each linear functional on = .
With this firmly in mind, there is one rather obvious way to obtain an element of
= ii . Namely, if #  = , consider the map #¢ = i ¦ - defined by
#² ³ ~  ²#³
which sends the linear functional  to the scalar  ²#³. The map # is called
evaluation at #. To see that #  = ii , if  Á   = i and Á   - , then
#² b ³ ~ ² b ³²#³ ~  ²#³ b ²#³ ~ #² ³ b #²³
and so # is indeed linear.
We can now define a map ¢ = ¦ = ii by
# ~ #
This is called the canonical map (or the natural map) from = to = ii . This
map is injective and hence in the finite-dimensional case, it is also surjective.
Theorem 3.13 The canonical map  ¢ = ¦ = ii defined by  # ~ #, where # is
evaluation at #, is a monomorphism. If = is finite-dimensional, then  is an
isomorphism.
Proof. The map  is linear since
" b #² ³ ~  ²" b #³ ~  ²"³ b  ²#³ ~ ²" b #³² ³
for all   = i . To determine the kernel of  , observe that
# ~  ¬ # ~ 
¬ #² ³ ~  for all   = i
¬  ²#³ ~  for all   = i
¬ #~
by Theorem 3.10 and so ker² ³ ~ ¸¹. In the finite-dimensional case, since

The Isomorphism Theorems

101

dim²= ii ³ ~ dim²= i ³ ~ dim²= ³
it follows that  is also surjective, hence an isomorphism.
Note that if dim²= ³  B, then since the dimensions of = and = ii are the same,
we deduce immediately that =  = ii . This is not the point of Theorem 3.13.
The point is that the natural map # ¦ # is an isomorphism. Because of this, =
is said to be algebraically reflexive. Theorem 3.13 and Theorem 3.12 together
imply that a vector space is algebraically reflexive if and only if it is finitedimensional.
If = is finite-dimensional, it is customary to identify the double dual space = ii
with = and to think of the elements of = ii simply as vectors in = . Let us
consider a specific example to show how algebraic reflexivity fails in the
infinite-dimensional case.
Example 3.4 Let = be the vector space over { with basis
 ~ ²Á Ã Á Á Á Á Ã ³
where the  is in the  th position. Thus, = is the set of all infinite binary
sequences with a finite number of 's. Define the order ²#³ of any #  = to be
the largest coordinate of # with value . Then ²#³  B for all #  = .
Consider the dual vectors i , defined (as usual) by
i ² ³ ~ Á
For any #  = , the evaluation functional # has the property that
#²i ³ ~ i ²#³ ~  if   ²#³
However, since the dual vectors i are linearly independent, there is a linear
functional   = ii for which
 ²i ³ ~ 
for all   . Hence,  does not have the form # for any #  = . This shows that
the canonical map is not surjective and so = is not algebraically reflexive.

Annihilators
The functions   = i are defined on vectors in = , but we may also define  on
subsets 4 of = by letting
 ²4 ³ ~ ¸ ²#³  #  4 ¹

102

Advanced Linear Algebra

Definition Let 4 be a nonempty subset of a vector space = . The annihilator
4  of 4 is
4  ~ ¸  = i   ²4 ³ ~ ¸¹¹
The term annihilator is quite descriptive, since 4  consists of all linear
functionals that annihilate (send to ) every vector in 4 . It is not hard to see
that 4  is a subspace of = i , even when 4 is not a subspace of = .
The basic properties of annihilators are contained in the following theorem.
Theorem 3.14
1) (Order-reversing) If 4 and 5 are nonempty subsets of = , then
4  5 ¬ 5  4
2) If dim²= ³  B, then for any nonempty subset 4 of = the natural map
¢ span²4 ³  4 
is an isomorphism from span²4 ³ onto 4  . In particular, if : is a
subspace of = , then :   : .
3) If : and ; are subspaces of = , then
²: q ; ³ ~ :  b ;  and ²: b ; ³ ~ :  q ; 
Proof. We leave proof of part 1) for the reader. For part 2), since
4  ~ ²span²4 ³³
it is sufficient to prove that ¢ :  :  is an isomorphism, where : is a
subspace of = . Now, we know that  is a monomorphism, so it remains to prove
that  : ~ :  . If  : , then  ~ has the property that for all   :  ,
² ³ ~  ~ 
and so  ~  :  , which implies that :  :  . Moreover, if #  :  , then
for all   :  we have
 ²#³ ~ #² ³ ~ 
and so every linear functional that annihilates : also annihilates #. But if # ¤ : ,
then there is a linear functional   = i for which ²:³ ~ ¸¹ and ²#³ £ .
(We leave proof of this as an exercise.) Hence, #  : and so # ~  #   : and
so :   : .
For part 3), it is clear that  annihilates : b ; if and only if  annihilates both
: and ; . Hence, ²: b ; ³ ~ :  q ;  . Also, if  ~  b   :  b ;  where
  :  and   ;  , then Á   ²: q ; ³ and so   ²: q ; ³ . Thus,

For the reverse inclusion, suppose that   ²: q ; ³ . Write

Annihilators and Direct Sums
Consider a direct sum decomposition
= ~: l;
Then any linear functional   ; i can be extended to a linear functional  on =
by setting  ²:³ ~ . Let us call this extension by . Clearly,   :  and it is
easy to see that the extension by  map  ¦  is an isomorphism from ; i to
:  , whose inverse is the restriction to ; .
Theorem 3.15 Let = ~ : l ; .
a) The extension by  map is an isomorphism from ; i to :  and so
; i  :
b) If = is finite-dimensional, then

Example 3.5 Part b) of Theorem 3.15 may fail in the infinite-dimensional case,
since it may easily happen that :   = i . As an example, let = be the vector
space over { with a countably infinite ordered basis 8 ~ ² Á  Á Ã ³. Let
: ~ º » and ; ~ º Á  Á Ã ». It is easy to see that :   ; i  = i and that

The annihilator provides a way to describe the dual space of a direct sum.
Theorem 3.16 A linear functional on the direct sum = ~ : l ; can be written
as a sum of a linear functional that annihilates : and a linear functional that
annihilates ; , that is,
²: l ; ³i ~ :  l ; 

Proof. Clearly :  q ;  ~ ¸¹, since any functional that annihilates both : and
; must annihilate : l ; ~ = . Hence, the sum :  b ;  is direct. The rest
follows from Theorem 3.14, since
= i ~ ¸¹ ~ ²: q ; ³ ~ :  b ;  ~ :  l ; 
Alternatively, since ; b : ~  is the identity map, if   = i , then we can
write
 ~  k ²; b : ³ ~ ² k ; ³ b ² k : ³  :  l ; 
and so = i ~ :  l ;  .

Operator Adjoints
If   B²= Á > ³, then we may define a map  d ¢ > * ¦ = i by
 d ² ³ ~  k  ~  
for   > * . (We will write composition as juxtaposition.) Thus, for any #  = ,
´ d ² ³µ²#³ ~  ² #³
The map  d is called the operator adjoint of  and can be described by the
phrase “apply  first.”
Theorem 3.17 (Properties of the Operator Adjoint)
1) For  Á   B²= Á > ³ and Á   - ,
² b  ³d ~  d b  d
2) For   B²= Á > ³ and   B²> Á < ³,
²³d ~ d  d
3) For any invertible   B²= ³,
² c ³d ~ ² d ³c
Proof. Proof of part 1) is left for the reader. For part 2), we have for all   < i ,
²³d ² ³ ~  ²³ ~ d ²  ³ ~ d ² d ² ³³ ~ ²d  d ³² ³
Part 3) follows from part 2) and
 d ² c ³d ~ ² c  ³d ~ d ~ 
and in the same way, ² c ³d  d ~  . Hence ² c ³d ~ ² d ³c .
If   B²= Á > ³, then  d  B(> i Á = i ) and so  dd  B²= ii Á > ii ³. Of course,
 dd is not equal to  . However, in the finite-dimensional case, if we use the
natural maps to identify = ii with = and > ii with > , then we can think of  dd

The Isomorphism Theorems

105

as being in B²= Á > ³. Using these identifications, we do have equality in the
finite-dimensional case.
Theorem 3.18 Let = and > be finite-dimensional and let   B²= Á > ³. If we
identify = ii with = and > ii with > using the natural maps, then  dd is
identified with  .
Proof. For any %  = let the corresponding element of = ii be denoted by % and
similarly for > . Then before making any identifications, we have for #  = ,
 dd ²#³² ³ ~ #´ d ² ³µ ~ #²  ³ ~  ² #³ ~  #² ³
for all   > * and so
 dd ²#³ ~  #  > ii
Therefore, using the canonical identifications for both = ii and > ii we have
 dd ²#³ ~  #
for all #  = .
The next result describes the kernel and image of the operator adjoint.
Theorem 3.19 Let   B²= Á > ³. Then
1) ker² d ³ ~ im² ³
2) im² d ³ ~ ker² ³
Proof. For part 1),
ker² d ³ ~ ¸  > i   d ² ³ ~ ¹
~ ¸  > i   ² = ³ ~ ¸¹¹
~ ¸  > i   ²im² ³³ ~ ¸¹¹
~ im² ³
For part 2), if  ~  ~  d   im² d ³, then ker² ³  ker² ³ and so
  ker² ³ .
For the reverse inclusion, let   ker² ³  = i . We wish to show that
 ~  d  ~  for some   > i . On 2 ~ ker² ³, there is no problem since 
and  d  ~  agree on 2 for any   > i . Let : be a complement of ker² ³.
Then  maps a basis 8 ~ ¸    0¹ for : to a linearly independent set
8 ~ ¸     0¹
in > and so we can define   > i on 8 by setting
²  ³ ~  
and extending to all of > . Then  ~  ~  d  on 8 and therefore on : . Thus,
 ~  d   im² d ³.

Corollary 3.20 Let   B²= Á > ³, where = and > are finite-dimensional.
Then rk² ³ ~ rk² d ³.
In the finite-dimensional case,  and  d can both be represented by matrices.
Let
8 ~ ² Á Ã Á  ³ and 9 ~ ² Á Ã Á  ³
be ordered bases for = and > , respectively, and let
i

be the corresponding dual bases. Then
²´ µ8Á9 ³Á ~ ²´  µ9 ³ ~ i ´  µ
and

Comparing the last two expressions we see that they are the same except that the
roles of  and  are reversed. Hence, the matrices in question are transposes.
Theorem 3.21 Let   B²= Á > ³, where = and > are finite-dimensional. If 8
and 9 are ordered bases for = and > , respectively, and 8 i and 9i are the
corresponding dual bases, then
´ d µ9i Á8i ~ ²´ µ8Á9 ³!
In words, the matrices of  and its operator adjoint  d are transposes of one
another.

Modules I: Basic Properties

Motivation
Let = be a vector space over a field - and let   B²= ³. Then for any
polynomial ²%³  - ´%µ, the operator ² ³ is well-defined. For instance, if
²%³ ~  b % b % , then
² ³ ~  b  b  
where  is the identity operator and   is the threefold composition  k  k  .
Thus, using the operator  we can define the product of a polynomial
²%³  - ´%µ and a vector #  = by
²%³# ~ ² ³²#³

(4.1)

This product satisfies the usual properties of scalar multiplication, namely, for
all ²%³Á ²%³  - ´%µ and "Á #  = ,
²%³²" b #³ ~ ²%³" b ²%³#
²²%³ b ²%³³" ~ ²%³" b ²%³"
´²%³ ²%³µ" ~ ²%³´ ²%³"µ
" ~ "
Thus, for a fixed   B²= ³, we can think of = as being endowed with the
operations of addition and multiplication of an element of = by a polynomial in
- ´%µ. However, since - ´%µ is not a field, these two operations do not make =
into a vector space. Nevertheless, the situation in which the scalars form a ring
but not a field is extremely important, not only in this context but in many
others.

Modules
Definition Let 9 be a commutative ring with identity, whose elements are
called scalars. An 9 -module (or a module over 9 ) is a nonempty set 4 ,

110

together with two operations. The first operation, called addition and denoted
by b , assigns to each pair ²"Á #³  4 d 4 , an element " b #  4 . The
second operation, denoted by juxtaposition, assigns to each pair
²Á #³  9 d 4 , an element #  4 . Furthermore, the following properties
must hold:
1) 4 is an abelian group under addition.
2) For all Á  9 and "Á #  4
²" b #³ ~ " b #
² b ³" ~ " b "
² ³" ~ ² "³
" ~ "
The ring 9 is called the base ring of 4 .
Note that vector spaces are just special types of modules: a vector space is a
module over a field.
When we turn in a later chapter to the study of the structure of a linear
transformation   B²= ³, we will think of = as having the structure of a vector
space over - as well as a module over - ´%µ and we will use the notation = . Put
another way, = is an abelian group under addition, with two scalar
multiplications—one whose scalars are elements of - and one whose scalars are
polynomials over - . This viewpoint will be of tremendous benefit for the study
of  . For now, we concentrate only on modules.
Example 4.1
1) If 9 is a ring, the set 9  of all ordered -tuples whose components lie in 9
is an 9 -module, with addition and scalar multiplication defined
componentwise (just as in -  ),
² Á Ã Á  ³ b ² Á Ã Á  ³ ~ ² b  Á Ã Á  b ³
and
² Á Ã Á  ³ ~ ² Á Ã Á  ³
for  ,  Á   9 . For example, { is the {-module of all ordered -tuples
of integers.
2) If 9 is a ring, the set CÁ ²9³ of all matrices of size  d  is an 9 module, under the usual operations of matrix addition and scalar
multiplication over 9 . Since 9 is a ring, we can also take the product of
matrices in CÁ ²9³. One important example is 9 ~ - ´%µ, whence
CÁ ²- ´%µ³ is the - ´%µ-module of all  d  matrices whose entries are
polynomials.
3) Any commutative ring 9 with identity is a module over itself, that is, 9 is
an 9 -module. In this case, scalar multiplication is just multiplication by

Modules I: Basic Properties

111

elements of 9, that is, scalar multiplication is the ring multiplication. The
defining properties of a ring imply that the defining properties of the 9 module 9 are satisfied. We shall use this example many times in the
sequel.

Importance of the Base Ring
Our definition of a module requires that the ring 9 of scalars be commutative.
Modules over noncommutative rings can exhibit quite a bit more unusual
behavior than modules over commutative rings. Indeed, as one would expect,
the general behavior of 9-modules improves as we impose more structure on
the base ring 9. If we impose the very strict structure of a field, the result is the
very well behaved vector space.
To illustrate, we will give an example of a module over a noncommutative ring
that has a basis of size  for every integer   ! As another example, if the
base ring is an integral domain, then whenever # Á Ã Á # are linearly
independent over 9 so are # Á Ã Á # for any nonzero   9 . This can fail
when 9 is not an integral domain.
We will also consider the property on the base ring 9 that all of its ideals are
finitely generated. In this case, any finitely generated 9 -module 4 has the
property that all of its submodules are also finitely generated. This property of
9 -modules fails if 9 does not have the stated property.
When 9 is a principal ideal domain (such as { or - ´%µ), each of its ideals is
generated by a single element. In this case, the 9 -modules are “reasonably” well
behaved. For instance, in general, a module may have a basis and yet possess a
submodule that has no basis. However, if 9 is a principal ideal domain, this
cannot happen.
Nevertheless, even when 9 is a principal ideal domain, 9 -modules are less well
behaved than vector spaces. For example, there are modules over a principal
ideal domain that do not have any linearly independent elements. Of course,
such modules cannot have a basis.

Submodules
Many of the basic concepts that we defined for vector spaces can also be
defined for modules, although their properties are often quite different. We
begin with submodules.
Definition A submodule of an 9 -module 4 is a nonempty subset : of 4 that
is an 9 -module in its own right, under the operations obtained by restricting the
operations of 4 to : . We write :  4 to denote the fact that : is a submodule
of 4 .
