Since any subspace : of an inner product space = is convex, Theorem 13.9
applies to complete subspaces. However, in this case, we can say more.
Theorem 13.10 Let = be an inner product space and let : be a complete

Let us denote the closure of the span of a set : of vectors by cspan²:³.
Theorem 13.13 Let / be a Hilbert space.
1) If ( is a subset of / , then
cspan²(³ ~ (
2) If : is a subspace of / , then
cl²:³ ~ : 
3) If 2 is a closed subspace of / , then
2 ~ 2 
Proof. We leave it as an exercise to show that ´cspan²(³µ ~ ( . Hence
/ ~ cspan²(³ p ´cspan²(³µ ~ cspan²(³ p (
But since ( is closed, we also have
/ ~ ( p (
and so by Theorem 13.12, cspan²(³ ~ ( . The rest follows easily from part
1 ).
In the exercises, we provide an example of a closed subspace 2 of an inner
product space = for which 2 £ 2  . Hence, we cannot drop the requirement
that / be a Hilbert space in Theorem 13.13.
Corollary 13.14 If ( is a subset of a Hilbert space / , then span²(³ is dense in
/ if and only if ( ~ ¸¹.
Proof. As in the previous proof,
/ ~ cspan²(³ p (
and so ( ~ ¸¹ if and only if / ~ cspan²(³.

Hilbert Bases
We recall the following definition from Chapter 9.
Definition A maximal orthonormal set in a Hilbert space / is called a Hilbert
basis for / .
Zorn's lemma can be used to show that any nontrivial Hilbert space has a Hilbert
basis. Again, we should mention that the concepts of Hilbert basis and Hamel
basis (a maximal linearly independent set) are quite different. We will show

336

later in this chapter that any two Hilbert bases for a Hilbert space have the same
cardinality.
Since an orthonormal set E is maximal if and only if E ~ ¸¹, Corollary
13.14 gives the following characterization of Hilbert bases.
Theorem 13.15 Let E be an orthonormal subset of a Hilbert space / . The
following are equivalent:
1) E is a Hilbert basis
2) E ~ ¸¹
3) E is a total subset of / , that is, cspan²E³ ~ / .
Part 3) of this theorem says that a subset of a Hilbert space is a Hilbert basis if
and only if it is a total orthonormal set.

Fourier Expansions
We now want to take a closer look at best approximations. Our goal is to find an
explicit expression for the best approximation to any vector % from within a
closed subspace : of a Hilbert space / . We will find it convenient to consider
three cases, depending on whether : has finite, countably infinite, or
uncountable dimension.

The Finite-Dimensional Case
Suppose that E ~ ¸" Á Ã Á " ¹ is an orthonormal set in a Hilbert space / .
Recall that the Fourier expansion of any %  / , with respect to E , is given by


%
V ~ º%Á " »"

where º%Á " » is the Fourier coefficient of % with respect to " . Observe that
º% c V

and so % c %

The Countably Infinite-Dimensional Case
In the countably infinite case, we will be dealing with infinite sums and so
questions of convergence will arise. Thus, we begin with the following.
Theorem 13.17 Let E ~ ¸" Á " Á Ã ¹ be a countably infinite orthonormal set in
a Hilbert space / . The series
B

(13.4)

 "

(that is, any series formed by rearranging the order of the terms also
converges). Finally, if the series (13.4) converges, then
B



Hence ²  ³ is a Cauchy sequence in / if and only if ² ³ is a Cauchy sequence
in s. Since both / and s are complete, ²  ³ converges if and only if ² ³
converges.
If the series (13.5) converges, then it converges absolutely and hence
unconditionally. (A real series converges unconditionally if and only if it

338

converges absolutely.³ But if (13.5) converges unconditionally, then so does
(13.4). The last part of the theorem follows from the continuity of the norm.
Now let E ~ ¸" Á " Á Ã ¹ be a countably infinite orthonormal set in / . The
Fourier expansion of a vector %  / is defined to be the sum
B

%
V ~ º%Á " »"

(13.6)

~

To see that this sum converges, observe that for any   , (13.3) gives

and so
B

(º%Á " »(  )%)
~

which shows that the series on the left converges. Hence, according to Theorem
13.17, the Fourier expansion (13.6) converges unconditionally.
Moreover, since the inner product is continuous,
º% c V

V " » ~ 
and so % c %
V  ´span²E³µ ~ ´cspan²E³µ . Hence, %

Thus, the following analog of Theorem 13.16 holds.

The Arbitrary Case
To discuss the case of an arbitrary orthonormal set E ~ ¸"    2¹, let us
first define and discuss the concept of the sum of an arbitrary number of terms.
(This is a bit of a digression, since we could proceed without all of the coming
details c but they are interesting.³
Definition Let A ~ ¸%    2¹ be an arbitrary family of vectors in an inner
product space = . The sum
 %
2

is said to converge to a vector %  = and we write
% ~  %

For those readers familiar with the language of convergence of nets, the set
F ²2³ of all finite subsets of 2 is a directed set under inclusion (for every
(Á )  F ²2³ there is a *  F ²2³ containing ( and ) ) and the function
: ¦ %
:

is a net in / . Convergence of ²13.7) is convergence of this net. In any case, we
will refer to the preceding definition as the net definition of convergence.
It is not hard to verify the following basic properties of net convergence for
arbitrary sums.
Theorem 13.19 Let A ~ ¸%    2¹ be an arbitrary family of vectors in an

The next result gives a useful “Cauchy-type” description of convergence.
Theorem 13.20 Let A ~ ¸%    2¹ be an arbitrary family of vectors in an
inner product space = .
1) If the sum

1 q 0 ~ JÁ 1 finite ¬ i % i  

2) If = is a Hilbert space, then the converse of 1) also holds.

The following theorem tells us that convergence of an arbitrary sum implies that
only countably many terms can be nonzero so, in some sense, there is no such
thing as a nontrivial uncountable sum.
Theorem 13.21 Let A ~ ¸%    2¹ be an arbitrary family of vectors in an

Here is the analog of Theorem 13.17.
Theorem 13.22 Let E ~ ¸"    2¹ be an arbitrary orthonormal family of
vectors in a Hilbert space / . The two series
 " and ( (
2

2

converge or diverge together. If these series converge, then



i   " i ~ ( (
2

2

Proof. The first series converges if and only if for every   , there exists a
finite set 0  2 such that


1 q 0 ~ JÁ 1 finite ¬ i " i  
1

or equivalently,
1 q 0 ~ JÁ 1 finite ¬ ( (  
1

and this is precisely what it means for the second series to converge. We leave
proof of the remaining statement to the reader.
The following is a useful characterization of arbitrary sums of nonnegative real
terms.
Theorem 13.23 Let ¸    2¹ be a collection of nonnegative real numbers.
Then
  ~ sup  
1 finite
1 2

2

1

provided that either of the preceding expressions is finite.
Proof. Suppose that
sup  ~ 9  B

1 finite
1 2 1

Then, for any   , there exists a finite set :  2 such that
9    9 c 
:

(13.8)

Hilbert Spaces

343

Hence, if ;  2 is a finite set for which ;  : , then since   ,
9      9 c 
;

:

and so
i9 c  i  
;

which shows that  converges to 9. Finally, if the sum on the left of (13.8)
converges, then the supremum on the right is finite and so (13.8) holds.
The reader may have noticed that we have two definitions of convergence for
countably infinite series: the net version and the traditional version involving
the limit of partial sums. Let us write
B

 % and  %
ob

~

for the net version and the partial sum version, respectively. Here is the
relationship between these two definitions.
Theorem 13.24 Let / be a Hilbert space. If %  / , then the following are
equivalent:
1)
2)

 % converges (net version) to %

ob
B

 % converges unconditionally to %

~

Proof. Assume that 1) holds. Suppose that  is any permutation of ob . Given
any   , there is a finite set :  ob for which
;  :Á ; finite ¬ i % c %i  
;

Let us denote the set of integers ¸Á Ã Á ¹ by 0 and choose a positive integer 
such that ²0 ³  : . Then for    we have


²0 ³  ²0 ³  : ¬ i %²³ c %i ~
~

and so 2) holds.

 % c %  
²0 ³

344

Advanced Linear Algebra

Next, assume that 2) holds, but that the series in 1) does not converge. Then
there exists an    such that for any finite subset 0  ob , there exists a finite
subset 1 with 1 q 0 ~ J for which
i %  i  
1

From this, we deduce the existence of a countably infinite sequence 1 of
mutually disjoint finite subsets of ob with the property that
max²1 ³ ~ 4  b ~ min²1b ³
and
i  % i  
1

Now we choose any permutation ¢ ob ¦ ob with the following properties
1) ²´ Á 4 µ³  ´ Á 4 µ
2) if 1 ~ ¸Á Á Ã Á Á" ¹, then
² ³ ~ Á Á ² b ³ ~ Á2 Á Ã Á ² b " c ³ ~ Á"
The intention in property 2) is that for each ,  takes a set of consecutive
integers to the integers in 1 .
For any such permutation , we have
 b" c

i  %²³ i ~ i  % i  
~

1

which shows that the sequence of partial sums of the series
B

%²³
~

is not Cauchy and so this series does not converge. This contradicts 2) and
shows that 2) implies at least that 1) converges. But if 1) converges to &  / ,
then since 1) implies 2) and since unconditional limits are unique, we have
& ~ %. Hence, 2) implies 1).
Now we can return to the discussion of Fourier expansions. Let
E ~ ¸"    2¹ be an arbitrary orthonormal set in a Hilbert space / . Given
any %  / , we may apply Theorem 13.16 to all finite subsets of E , to deduce

Hilbert Spaces

345

that
sup (º%Á " »(  )%)

1 finite
1 2

1

and so Theorem 13.23 tells us that the sum
(º%Á " »(

%

The continuity of infinite sums with respect to the inner product (Theorem

and so % c %

Thus, we arrive at the most general form of a key theorem about Hilbert spaces.
Theorem 13.25 Let E ~ ¸"    2¹ be an orthonormal family of vectors in
a Hilbert space / . For any %  / , the Fourier expansion

A Characterization of Hilbert Bases
Recall from Theorem 13.15 that an orthonormal set E ~ ¸"    2¹ in a
Hilbert space / is a Hilbert basis if and only if
cspan²E³ ~ /
Theorem 13.25, then leads to the following characterization of Hilbert bases.
Theorem 13.26 Let E ~ ¸"    2¹ be an orthonormal family in a Hilbert
space / . The following are equivalent:
1) E is a Hilbert basis (a maximal orthonormal set)
2) E ~ ¸¹
3) E is total (that is, cspan²E³ ~ / )
4) % ~ %
V for all %  /
5) Equality holds in Bessel's inequality for all %  / , that is,

6) Parseval's identity

2

Proof. Parts 1), 2) and 3) are equivalent by Theorem 13.15. Part 4) implies part
3), since %
V  cspan²E³ and 3) implies 4) since the unique best approximation of
any %  cspan²E³ is itself and so % ~ %
V. Parts 3) and 5) are equivalent by
Theorem 13.25. Parseval's identity follows from part 4) using Theorem 13.19.
Finally, Parseval's identity for & ~ % implies that equality holds in Bessel's
inequality.

Hilbert Dimension
We now wish to show that all Hilbert bases for a Hilbert space / have the same
cardinality and so we can define the Hilbert dimension of / to be that
cardinality.

Theorem 13.27 All Hilbert bases for a Hilbert space / have the same
cardinality. This cardinality is called the Hilbert dimension of / , which we
denote by hdim²/³.
Proof. If / has a finite Hilbert basis, then that set is also a Hamel basis and so
all finite Hilbert bases have size dim²/³. Suppose next that 8 ~ ¸    2¹

A Characterization of Hilbert Spaces
We have seen that any vector space = is isomorphic to a vector space ²- ) ³ of
all functions from ) to - that have finite support. There is a corresponding
result for Hilbert spaces. Let 2 be any nonempty set and let
M ²2³ ~ D ¢ 2 ¦ dc ( ²³(  BE
2

The functions in M ²2³ are referred to as square summable functions. ²We can
also define a real version of this set by replacing d by s.³ We define an inner
product on M ²2³ by
º Á » ~  ²³²³

The proof that M ²2³ is a Hilbert space is quite similar to the proof that

348

M ~ M ²o³ is a Hilbert space and the details are left to the reader. If we define
  M ²2³ by
 ²³ ~ Á ~ F




if  ~ 
if  £ 

then the collection
E ~ ¸    2¹
is a Hilbert basis for M ²2³, of cardinality (2 (. To see this, observe that
º Á  » ~  ²³ ²³ ~ Á
2

and so E is orthonormal. Moreover, if   M ²2³, then  ²³ £  for only a
countable number of   2 , say ¸ Á  Á Ã ¹. If we define  Z by

then   cspan²E³ and  ²³ ~  ²³ for all   2 , which implies that  ~  Z .
This shows that M ²2³ ~ cspan²E³ and so E is a total orthonormal set, that is, a
Hilbert basis for M ²2³.
Now let / be a Hilbert space, with Hilbert basis 8 ~ ¸"    2¹. We define
a map ¢ / ¦ M ²2³ as follows. Since 8 is a Hilbert basis, any %  / has the
form

Since the series on the right converges, Theorem 13.22 implies that the series

converges. Hence, another application of Theorem 13.22 implies that the
following series converges:
²%³ ~ º%Á " »
2

It follows from Theorem 13.19 that  is linear and it is not hard to see that it is
also bijective. Notice that ²" ³ ~  and so  takes the Hilbert basis 8 for /

Theorem 13.29 If / is a Hilbert space of Hilbert dimension  and if 2 is any

The Riesz Representation Theorem
We conclude our discussion of Hilbert spaces by discussing the Riesz
representation theorem. As it happens, not all linear functionals on a Hilbert
space have the form “take the inner product withÃ ,” as in the finitedimensional case. To see this, observe that if &  / , then the function
& ²%³ ~ º%Á &»
is certainly a linear functional on / . However, it has a special property. In
particular, the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality gives, for all %  / ,
(& ²%³( ~ (º%Á &»(  )%))&)
or, for all % £ ,
(& ²%³(

Noticing that equality holds if % ~ & , we have

This prompts us to make the following definition, which we do for linear

The set of all bounded linear functionals on a Hilbert space / is called the
continuous dual space, or conjugate space, of / and denoted by / i . Note
that this differs from the algebraic dual of / , which is the set of all linear
functionals on / . In the finite-dimensional case, however, since all linear
functionals are bounded (exercise), the two concepts agree. (Unfortunately,
there is no universal agreement on the notation for the algebraic dual versus the
continuous dual. Since we will discuss only the continuous dual in this section,
no confusion should arise.³
The following theorem gives some simple reformulations of the definition of

Theorem 13.32 (The Riesz representation theorem) Let / be a Hilbert

Proof. If  ~ , we may take ' ~ , so let us assume that  £ . Hence,
2 ~ ker² ³ £ / and since  is continuous, 2 is closed. Thus
/ ~ 2 p 2
Now, the first isomorphism theorem, applied to the linear functional  ¢ / ¦ - ,
implies that /°2  - (as vector spaces). In addition, Theorem 3.5 implies that

Tensor Products

In the preceding chapters, we have seen several ways to construct new vector
spaces from old ones. Two of the most important such constructions are the
direct sum < l = and the vector space B²< Á = ³ of all linear transformations
from < to = . In this chapter, we consider another very important construction,
known as the tensor product.

Universality
We begin by describing a general type of universality that will help motivate the
definition of tensor product. Our description is strongly related to the formal
notion of a universal pair in category theory, but we will be somewhat less
formal to avoid the need to formally define categorical concepts. Accordingly,
the terminology that we shall introduce is not standard, but does not contradict
any standard terminology.
Referring to Figure 14.1, consider a set ( and two functions  and , with
domain (.
f

X
Figure 14.1

Suppose that there exists a function ¢ : ¦ ? for which this diagram
commutes, that is,
~ k
This is sometimes expressed by saying that  can be factored through  . What
does this say about the relationship between the functions  and ?

356

Advanced Linear Algebra

Let us think of the “information” about ( contained in a function ¢ ( ¦ ) as
the way in which  distinguishes elements of ( using labels from ) . The
relationship above implies that
²³ £ ²³ ¬  ²³ £  ²³
and this can be phrased by saying that whatever ability  has to distinguish
elements of ( is also possessed by  . Put another way, except for labeling
differences, any information about ( that is contained in  is also contained in
.
If  happens to be injective, then the only difference between  and  is the
values of the labels. That is, the two functions have the same information about
(. However, in general,  is not required to be injective and so  may contain
more information than .
Now consider a family I of sets and a family
< ~ ¸¢ ( ¦ ?  ?  I ¹
Assume that :  I and  ¢ ( ¦ :  < . If the diagram in Figure 14.1 commutes
for all   < , then the information contained in every function in < is also
contained in  . Moreover, since   < , the function  cannot contain more
information than is contained in the entire family and so we conclude that 
contains exactly the same information as is contained in the entire family < . In
this sense,  ¢ ( ¦ : is universal among all functions ¢ ( ¦ ? in < .
In this way, a single function  ¢ ( ¦ : , or more precisely, a single pair ²:Á  ³,
can capture a mathematical concept as described by a family of functions. Some
examples from linear algebra are basis for a vector space, quotient space, direct
sum and bilinearity (as we will see).
Let us make a formal definition.
Definition Referring to Figure 14.2, let ( be a set and let I be a family of sets.
Let
< ~ ¸¢ ( ¦ ?  ?  I ¹
be a family of functions, all of which have domain ( and range a member of I .
Let

be a family of functions with domain and range in I . We assume that > has the
following structure:
1) > contains the identity function : for each member of I .

2) > is closed under composition of functions, which is an associative
operation.

A pair ²:Á  ¢ ( ¦ :³, where :  I and   < has the universal property for
the family < as measured by >, or is a universal pair for ²< Á >³, if for every
¢ ( ¦ ? in < , there is a unique  ¢ : ¦ ? in > for which the diagram in
Figure 14.1 commutes, that is, for which
~ k
or equivalently, any   < can be factored through  . The unique measuring
function  is called the mediating morphism for .
Note the requirement that the mediating morphism  be unique. Universal pairs
are essentially unique, as the following describes.
Theorem 14.1 Let ²:Á  ¢ ( ¦ :³ and ²; Á ¢ ( ¦ ; ³ be universal pairs for
²< Á >³. Then there is a bijective measuring function   > for which : ~ ; .
In fact, the mediating morphism of  with respect to  and the mediating
morphism of  with respect to  are isomorphisms.
Proof. With reference to Figure 14.3, there are mediating morphisms ¢ : ¦ ;
and ¢ ; ¦ : for which
~ k
 ~k
Hence,
 ~ ² k  ³ k 
 ~ ² k  ³ k 
However, referring to the third diagram in Figure 14.3, both  k  ¢ : ¦ : and
the identity map ¢ : ¦ : are mediating morphisms for  and so the uniqueness

of mediating morphisms implies that  k  ~  . Similarly  k  ~  and so  and
 are inverses of one another, making  the desired bijection.

Examples of Universality
Now let us look at some examples of the universal property. Let Vect²- ³ denote
the family of all vector spaces over the base field - . (We use the term family
informally to represent what in set theory is formally referred to as a class. A
class is a “collection” that is too large to be considered a set. For example,
Vect²- ³ is a class.)
Example 14.1 (Bases) Let 8 be a nonempty set and let
1) I ~ Vect²- ³
2) < ~ set functions from 8 to members of <
3) > ~ linear transformations
If =8 is a vector space with basis 8 , then the pair ²=8 Á ¢ 8 ¦ =8 ³, where  is
the inclusion map # ~ #, is universal for ²< Á >³. To see this, note that the
condition that   < can be factored through ,
~ k
is equivalent to the statement that  # ~ # for each basis vector #  8 . But this
uniquely defines a linear transformation  .
In fact, the universality of the pair ²=8 Á ³ is precisely the statement that a linear
transformation  is uniquely determined by assigning its values arbitrarily on a
basis 8 , the function  doing the arbitrary assignment in this context. Note also
that Theorem 14.1 implies that if ²> Á ¢ 8 ¦ > ³ is also universal for ²< Á >³,
then there is a bijective mediating morphism from =8 to > , that is, > and =8
are isomorphic.
Example 14.2 (Quotient spaces and canonical projections) Let = be a vector
space and let 2 be a subspace of = . Let
1) I ~ Vect²- ³

Tensor Products

359

2) < ~ linear maps with domain = , whose kernels contain 2
3) > ~ linear transformations
Theorem 3.4 says precisely that the pair ²= °2Á ¢ = ¦ = °2³, where  is the
canonical projection map, has the universal property for < as measured by >.
Example 14.3 (Direct sums) Let < and = be vector spaces over - . Let
1) I ~ Vect²- ³
2) < ~ ordered pairs ² ¢ < ¦ > Á ¢ = ¦ > ³ of linear transformations
3) > ~ linear transformations
Here we have a slight variation on the definition of universal pair: In this case,
< is a family of pairs of functions. For   > and ² Á ³  < , we set
 k ² Á ³ ~ ² k  Á  k ³
Then the pair ²< ^ = Á ² Á  ³¢ ²< Á = ³ ¦ < ^ = ³, where
 " ~ ²"Á ³

and  # ~ ²Á #³

are called the canonical injections, has the universal property for ²< Á >³. To
see this, observe that for any pair ² Á ³¢ ²< Á = ³ ¦ > in < , the condition
² Á ³ ~  k ² Á  ³
is equivalent to
² Á ³ ~ ² k  Á  k  ³
or
 ²"Á ³ ~  ²"³

and

 ²Á #³ ~ ²#³

But these conditions define a unique linear transformation  ¢ < ^ = ¦ > .
Thus, bases, quotient spaces and direct sums are all examples of universal pairs
and it should be clear from these examples that the notion of universal property
is, well, universal. In fact, it happens that the most useful definition of tensor
product is through a universal property, which we now explore.

Bilinear Maps
The universality that defines tensor products rests on the notion of a bilinear
map.
Definition Let < , = and > be vector spaces over - . Let < d = be the
cartesian product of < and = as sets. A set function
¢ < d = ¦ >

360

Advanced Linear Algebra

is bilinear if it is linear in both variables separately, that is, if
 ²" b "Z Á #³ ~  ²"Á #³ b  ²"Z Á #³
and
 ²"Á # b #Z ³ ~  ²"Á #³ b  ²"Á #Z ³
The set of all bilinear functions from < d = to > is denoted by
hom- ²< Á = Â > ³. A bilinear function  ¢ < d = ¦ - with values in the base
field - is called a bilinear form on < d = .
Note that bilinearity can also be expressed in matrix language as follows: If
 ~ ² Á Ã Á  ³  -  Á

 ~ ² Á Ã Á  ³  - 

" ~ ²" Á Ã Á " ³  <  Á

# ~ ²# Á Ã Á # ³  = 

and

then  ¢ < d = ¦ > is bilinear if
 ²"! Á #! ³ ~ -  !
where - ~ ´ ²" Á # ³µÁ .
It is important to emphasize that, in the definition of bilinear function, < d = is
the cartesian product of sets, not the direct product of vector spaces. In other
words, we do not consider any algebraic structure on < d = when defining
bilinear functions, so expressions like
²%Á &³ b ²'Á $³

and ²%Á &³

are meaningless.
In fact, if = is a vector space, there are two classes of functions from = d = to
> : the linear maps B²= d = Á > ³, where = d = ~ = ^ = is the direct
product of vector spaces, and the bilinear maps hom²= Á = Â > ³, where = d = is
just the cartesian product of sets. We leave it as an exercise to show that these
two classes have only the zero map in common. In other words, the only map
that is both linear and bilinear is the zero map.
We made a thorough study of bilinear forms on a finite-dimensional vector
space = in Chapter 11 (although this material is not assumed here). However,
bilinearity is far more important and far-reaching than its application to metric
vector spaces, as the following examples show. Indeed, both multiplication and
evaluation are bilinear.
Example 14.4 (Multiplication is bilinear) If ( is an algebra, the product map
¢ ( d ( ¦ ( defined by

Tensor Products

361

²Á ³ ~ 
is bilinear, that is, multiplication is linear in each position.
Example 14.5 (Evaluation is bilinear) If = and > are vector spaces, then the
evaluation map ¢ B²= Á > ³ d = ¦ > defined by
² Á #³ ~  #
is bilinear. In particular, the evaluation map ¢ = i d = ¦ - defined by
² Á #³ ~  # is a bilinear form on = i d = .
Example 14.6 If = and > are vector spaces, and   = i and   > i , then the
product map ¢ = d > ¦ - defined by
²#Á $³ ~  ²#³²$³
is bilinear. Dually, if #  = and $  > , then the map ¢ = i d > i ¦ defined by
² Á ³ ~  ²#³²$³
is bilinear.
It is precisely the tensor product that will allow us to generalize the previous
example. In particular, if   B²< Á > ³ and   B²= Á > ³, then we would like
to consider a “product” map ¢ < d = ¦ > defined by
²"Á #³ ~  ²"³ ? ²#³
The tensor product n is just the thing to replace the question mark, because it
has the desired bilinearity property, as we will see. In fact, the tensor product is
bilinear and nothing else, so it is exactly what we need!

Tensor Products
Let < and = be vector spaces. Our guide for the definition of the tensor product
< n = will be the desire to have a universal property for bilinear functions, as
measured by linearity. Referring to Figure 14.4, we want to define a vector
space ; and a bilinear map !¢ < d = ¦ ; so that any bilinear map  with
domain < d = can be factored through !. Intuitively speaking, ! is the most
“general” or “universal” bilinear map with domain < d = : It is bilinear and
nothing more.

be the family of all bilinear maps from < d = to any vector space > . The

A pair ²; Á !¢ < d = ¦ ; ³ is universal for bilinearity if it is universal for

linear transformation ¢ ; ¦ > for which
 ~ k!
The map  is called the mediating morphism for  .
We can now define the tensor product via this universal property.
Definition Let < and = be vector spaces over a field - . Any universal pair
²; Á !¢ < d = ¦ ; ³ for bilinearity is called a tensor product of < and = . The
vector space ; is denoted by < n = and sometimes referred to by itself as the
tensor product. The map ! is called the tensor map and the elements of < n =
are called tensors.
It is customary to use the symbol n to denote the image of any ordered pair
²"Á #³ under the tensor map, that is,
" n # ~ !²"Á #³
for any "  < and #  = . A tensor of the form " n # is said to be
decomposable, that is, the decomposable tensors are the images under the
tensor map.
Since universal pairs are unique up to isomorphism, we may refer to “the”
tensor product of vector spaces. Note also that the tensor product n is not a
product in the sense of a binary operation on a set. In fact, even when = ~ < ,
the tensor product " n " is not in < , but rather in < n < .
