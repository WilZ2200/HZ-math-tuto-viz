The Jordan Canonical Form
One of the virtues of the rational canonical form is that every linear operator on
a finite-dimensional vector space has a rational canonical form. However, as
mentioned earlier, the rational canonical form may be far from the ideal of
simplicity that we had in mind for a set of simple canonical forms and is really
more of a theoretical tool than a practical tool.
When the minimal polynomial  ²%³ of  splits over - ,
 ²%³ ~ ²% c  ³ Ä²% c  ³
there is another set of canoncial forms that is arguably simpler than the set of
rational canonical forms.
In some sense, the complexity of the rational canonical form comes from the
choice of basis for the cyclic submodules ºº#Á »». Recall that the  -cyclic bases
have the form
8Á ~ 2#Á Á  #Á Á Ã Á  Á c #Á 3


where Á ~ deg² Á ³. With this basis, all of the complexity comes at the end,
so to speak, when we attempt to express
 ² Á c ²#Á ³³ ~  Á ²#Á ³
as a linear combination of the basis vectors.
However, since 8Á has the form
2#Á  #Á   #Á Ã Á  c #3
any ordered set of the form
 ² ³#Á  ² ³#Á Ã Á c ² ³#
where deg² ²%³³ ~  will also be a basis for ºº#Á »». In particular, when  ²%³
splits over - , the elementary divisors are


 Á ²%³ ~ ²% c  ³Á
and so the set
9Á ~ 2#Á Á ² c  ³#Á Á Ã Á ² c  ³Á c #Á 3
is also a basis for ºº#Á »».
If we temporarily denote the  th basis vector in 9Á by  , then for

which is called a Jordan block associated with the scalar  . Note that a Jordan
block has  's on the main diagonal, 's on the subdiagonal and 's elsewhere.
Let us refer to the basis
9 ~ 9Á
as a Jordan basis for  .
Theorem 8.6 (The Jordan canonical form) Suppose that the minimal
polynomial of   B²= ³ splits over the base field - , that is,
 ²%³ ~ ²% c  ³ Ä²% c  ³

where the polynomials ²% c  ³Á are the elementary divisors of  . This
block diagonal matrix is said to be in Jordan canonical form and is called
the Jordan canonical form of  .
2) If - is algebraically closed, then up to order of the block diagonal
matrices, the set of matrices in Jordan canonical form constitutes a set of
canonical forms for similarity.
Proof. For part 2), the companion matrix and corresponding Jordan block are
similar:

since they both represent the same operator  on the subspace ºº#Á »». It follows
that the rational canonical matrix and the Jordan canonical matrix for  are
similar.
Note that the diagonal elements of the Jordan canonical form @ of  are
precisely the eigenvalues of  , each appearing a number of times equal to its
algebraic multiplicity. In general, the rational canonical form does not “expose”
the eigenvalues of the matrix, even when these eigenvalues lie in the base field.

Triangularizability and Schur's Lemma
We have discussed two different canonical forms for similarity: the rational
canonical form, which applies in all cases and the Jordan canonical form, which
applies only when the base field is algebraically closed. Moreover, there is an
annoying sense in which these sets of canoncial forms leave something to be
desired: One is too complex and the other does not always exist.
Let us now drop the rather strict requirements of canonical forms and look at
two classes of matrices that are too large to be canonical forms (the upper
triangular matrices and the almost upper triangular matrices) and one class of
matrices that is too small to be a canonical form (the diagonal matrices).
The upper triangular matrices (or lower triangular matrices) have some nice
algebraic properties and it is of interest to know when an arbitrary matrix is
similar to a triangular matrix. We confine our attention to upper triangular
matrices, since there are direct analogs for lower triangular matrices as well.
Definition A linear operator   B²= ³ is upper triangularizable if there is an
ordered basis 8 ~ ²# Á Ã Á # ³ of = for which the matrix ´ µ8 is upper
triangular, or equivalently, if
#  º# Á Ã Á # »
for all  ~ Á Ã Á .
As we will see next, when the base field is algebraically closed, all operators are
upper triangularizable. However, since two distinct upper triangular matrices
can be similar, the class of upper triangular matrices is not a canonical form for
similarity. Simply put, there are just too many upper triangular matrices.
Theorem 8.7 (Schur's theorem) Let = be a finite-dimensional vector space
over a field - .
1) If the characteristic polynomial (or minimal polynomial) of   B²= ³ splits
over - , then  is upper triangularizable.
2) If - is algebraically closed, then all operators are upper triangularizable.

Proof. Part 2) follows from part 1). The proof of part 1) is most easily
accomplished by matrix means, namely, we prove that every square matrix
(  4 ²- ³ whose characteristic polynomial splits over - is similar to an upper
triangular matrix. If  ~  there is nothing to prove, since all  d  matrices are
upper triangular. Assume the result is true for  c  and let (  4 ²- ³.
Let # be an eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue   - of ( and extend
¸# ¹ to an ordered basis 8 ~ ²# Á Ã Á # ³ for s . The matrix of ( with respect

det ²%0 c (³ ~ det ²%0 c ´( µ8 ³ ~ ²% c  ³ det ²%0 c ( ³
Hence, the characteristic polynomial of ( also splits over - and the induction

The Real Case
When the base field is - ~ s, an operator  is upper triangularizable if and
only if its characteristic polynomial splits over s. (Why?) We can, however,
always achieve a form that is close to triangular by permitting values on the first
subdiagonal.
Before proceeding, let us recall Theorem 7.11, which says that for a module >
of prime order  ²%³, the following are equivalent:
1)
2)
3)
4)
5)

> is cyclic
> is indecomposable
 ²%³ is irreducible
 is nonderogatory, that is,  ²%³ ~  ²%³

However, there is a more appealing matrix representation of  . To this end, let

then ) has the same two distinct eigenvalues as ( and so ( and ) have the

Now we can proceed with the real version of Schur's theorem. For the sake of

for Á   - . A linear operator   B²= ³ is almost upper triangularizable if
there is an ordered basis 8 for which ´ µ8 is almost upper triangular.
To see that every real linear operator is almost upper triangularizable, we use
Theorem 7.19, which states that if ²%³ is a prime factor of  ²%³, then = has a
cyclic submodule > of order ²%³. Hence, > is a  -cyclic subspace of
dimension deg²²%³³ and  O> has characteristic polynomial ²%³.
Now, the minimal polynomial of a real operator   B²= ³ factors into a product
of linear and irreducible quadratic factors. If  ²%³ has a linear factor over - ,
then = has a one-dimensional  -invariant subspace > . If  ²%³ has an
irreducible quadratic factor ²%³, then = has a cyclic submodule > of order
²%³ and so a matrix representation of  on > is given by the matrix

This is the basis for an inductive proof, as in the complex case.
Theorem 8.9 (Schur's theorem: real case) If = is a real vector space, then
every linear operator on = is almost upper triangularizable.
Proof. As with the complex case, it is simpler to proceed using matrices, by
showing that any  d  real matrix ( is similar to an almost upper triangular
matrix. The result is clear if  ~ . Assume for the purposes of induction that
any square matrix of size less than  d  is almost upper triangularizable.
We have just seen that -  has a one-dimensional ( -invariant subspace > or a
two-dimensional ( -cyclic subspace > , where ( has irreducible characteristic
polynomial on > . Hence, we may choose a basis 8 for -  for which the first

is almost upper triangular.

Unitary Triangularizability
Although we have not yet discussed inner product spaces and orthonormal
bases, the reader may very well be familiar with these concepts. For those who
are, we mention that when = is a real or complex inner product space, then if an
operator  on = can be triangularized (or almost triangularized) using an
ordered basis 8 , it can also be triangularized (or almost triangularized) using an
orthonormal ordered basis E .
To see this, suppose we apply the Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization process to a
basis 8 ~ ²# Á Ã Á # ³ that triangularizes (or almost triangularizes)  . The
resulting ordered orthonormal basis E ~ ²" Á Ã Á " ³ has the property that
º# Á Ã Á # » ~ º" Á Ã Á " »
for all   . Since ´ µ8 is (almost) upper triangular, that is,
#  º# Á Ã Á # »
for all   , it follows that
 "  º # Á Ã Á  # »  º# Á Ã Á # » ~ º" Á Ã Á " »
and so the matrix ´ µE is also (almost) upper triangular.
A linear operator  is unitarily upper triangularizable if there is an ordered
orthonormal basis with respect to which  is upper triangular. Accordingly,
when = is an inner product space, we can replace the term “upper
triangularizable” with “unitarily upper triangularizable” in Schur's theorem. (A
similar statement holds for almost upper triangular matrices.)

Diagonalizable Operators
Definition A linear operator   B²= ³ is diagonalizable if there is an ordered
basis 8 ~ ²# Á Ã Á # ³ of = for which the matrix ´ µ8 is diagonal, or
equivalently, if

 # ~  #
for all  ~ Á Ã Á .
The previous definition leads immediately to the following simple
characterization of diagonalizable operators.
Theorem 8.10 Let   B²= ³. The following are equivalent:
1)  is diagonalizable.
2) = has a basis consisting entirely of eigenvectors of  .
3) = has the form
= ~ ; l Ä l ;
where  Á Ã Á  are the distinct eigenvalues of  .
Diagonalizable operators can also be characterized in a simple way via their
minimal polynomials.
Theorem 8.11 A linear operator   B²= ³ on a finite-dimensional vector space
is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial is the product of distinct
linear factors.
Proof. If  is diagonalizable, then
= ~ ; l Ä l ;
and Theorem 7.7 implies that  ²%³ is the least common multiple of the
minimal polynomials % c  of  restricted to ; . Hence,  ²%³ is a product of
distinct linear factors. Conversely, if  ²%³ is a product of distinct linear
factors, then the primary decomposition of = has the form
= ~ = l Ä l =
where
= ~ ¸#  =  ² c  ³# ~ ¹ ~ ;
and so  is diagonalizable.

Spectral Resolutions
We have seen (Theorem 2.25) that resolutions of the identity on a vector space
= correspond to direct sum decompositions of = . We can do something similar
for any diagonalizable linear operator  on = (not just the identity operator).
Suppose that  has the form
 ~   b Ä b  
where  b Ä b  ~  is a resolution of the identity and the   - are
distinct. This is referred to as a spectral resolution of  .

We claim that the  's are the eigenvalues of  and im² ³ ~ ; . Theorem 2.25

If  #  im² ³, then
 ² #³ ~ ²  b Ä b   ³ # ~  ² #³

Real and Complex Inner Product Spaces

We now turn to a discussion of real and complex vector spaces that have an
additional function defined on them, called an inner product, as described in the
following definition. In this chapter, - will denote either the real or complex
field. Also, the complex conjugate of   d is denoted by .
Definition Let = be a vector space over - ~ s or - ~ d. An inner product
on = is a function ºÁ »¢ = d = ¦ - with the following properties:
1) (Positive definiteness) For all #  = ,
º#Á #»  

and º#Á #» ~  ¯ # ~ 

2) For - ~ d: (Conjugate symmetry)
º"Á #» ~ º#Á "»
For - ~ s: (Symmetry)
º"Á #» ~ º#Á "»
3) (Linearity in the first coordinate) For all "Á #  = and Á  º" b #Á $» ~ º"Á $» b º#Á $»
A real (or complex) vector space = , together with an inner product, is called a
real (or complex) inner product space.
If ?Á @  = , then we let
º?Á @ » ~ ¸º%Á &»  %  ?Á &  @ ¹
and
º#Á ?» ~ ¸º#Á %»  %  ?¹
Note that a vector subspace : of an inner product space = is also an inner
product space under the restriction of the inner product of = to : .

Advanced Linear Algebra

We will study bilinear forms (also called inner products) on vector spaces over
fields other than s or d in Chapter 11. Note that property 1) implies that º#Á #»
is always real, even if = is a complex vector space.
If - ~ s, then properties 2) and 3) imply that the inner product is linear in both
coordinates, that is, the inner product is bilinear. However, if - ~ d, then
º$Á " b #» ~ º" b #Á $» ~ º"Á $» b º#Á $» ~ º$Á "» b º$Á #»
This is referred to as conjugate linearity in the second coordinate. Specifically,
a function  ¢ = ¦ > between complex vector spaces is conjugate linear if
 ²" b #³ ~  ²"³ b  ²#³
and
 ²"³ ~  ²"³
for all "Á #  = and   d. Thus, a complex inner product is linear in its first
coordinate and conjugate linear in its second coordinate. This is often described
by saying that a complex inner product is sesquilinear. (Sesqui means “one and
a half times.”)
Example 9.1
1) The vector space s is an inner product space under the standard inner
product, or dot product, defined by
º² Á Ã Á  ³Á ²  Á Ã Á  ³» ~   b Ä b  
The inner product space s is often called -dimensional Euclidean
space.
2) The vector space d is an inner product space under the standard inner
product defined by
º² Á Ã Á  ³Á ²  Á Ã Á  ³» ~   b Ä b  
This inner product space is often called -dimensional unitary space.
3) The vector space *´Á µ of all continuous complex-valued functions on the
closed interval ´Á µ is a complex inner product space under the inner
product

Example 9.2 One of the most important inner product spaces is the vector space
M of all real (or complex) sequences ²  ³ with the property that

Such sequences are called square summable. Of course, for this inner product
to make sense, the sum on the right must converge. To see this, note that if
²  ³Á ²! ³  M , then
  ²(  ( c (! (³ ~ (  ( c (  ((! ( b (! (
and so
(  ! (  (  ( b (! (
which implies that ²  ! ³  M . We leave it to the reader to verify that M is an
inner product space.
The following simple result is quite useful.
Lemma 9.1 If = is an inner product space and º"Á %» ~ º#Á %» for all %  = ,
then " ~ #.
The next result points out one of the main differences between real and complex
inner product spaces and will play a key role in later work.

2) If = is a complex inner product space, then
º #Á #» ~  for all #  =

but this does not hold in general for real inner product spaces.
Proof. Part 1) follows directly from Lemma 9.1. As for part 2), let # ~ % b &,

and setting  ~  gives

º %Á &» c º &Á %» ~ 
These two equations imply that º %Á &» ~  for all %Á &  = and so part 1)
implies that  ~ . For the last statement, rotation by  degrees in the real
plane s has the property that º #Á #» ~  for all #.

which is equivalent to the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. Furthermore, equality
holds if and only if )" c #) ~ , that is, if and only if " c # ~ , which is
equivalent to " and # being scalar multiples of one another.
To prove the triangle inequality, the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality gives

from which the triangle inequality follows. The proof of the statement
concerning equality is left to the reader.
Any vector space = , together with a function ) h )¢ = ¦ s that satisfies
properties 1), 2) and 4) of Theorem 9.3, is called a normed linear space and the
function ) h ) is called a norm. Thus, any inner product space is a normed linear
space, under the norm given by (9.1).
It is interesting to observe that the inner product on = can be recovered from the
norm. Thus, knowing the length of all vectors in = is equivalent to knowing all
inner products of vectors in = .

The norm can be used to define the distance between any two vectors in an
