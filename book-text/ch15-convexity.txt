We can now prove (15.1) and (15.2).
Theorem 15.7 Let : be a subspace of s .
1) : q sb ~ J if and only if :  q sbb £ J

2) : q sbb ~ J if and only if :  q sb

Proof. In both cases, one direction is easy. It is clear that there cannot exist


vectors "  sbb and #  sb
that are orthogonal. Hence, : q sb

: q sbb cannot both be nonempty and so : q sbb £ J implies

: q sb ~ J. Also, : q sbb and :  q sb




: q sb £ J implies that : q sbb ~ J.
For the converse in part 1), to prove that
: q sb ~ J

:  q sbb £ J

a good candidate for an element of :  q sbb would be a normal to a
hyperplane that separates : from a subset of sb . Note that our separation

theorems do not allow us to separate : from sb , because sb
is not compact. So
consider instead the convex hull " of the standard basis vectors  Á Ã Á  in
sb :
" ~ ¸!  b Ä b !     !  Á '! ~ ¹
which is compact. Moreover, "  sb implies that " q : ~ J and so Theorem

for all   "À Taking  ~  gives

and so 5  :  q sbb , which is therefore nonempty.
To prove part 2), again we note that there cannot exist orthogonal vectors


and so : q sbb

Thus, : q sb £ J implies that : q sbb ~ J.

Inhomogeneous Systems
We now turn our attention to inhomogeneous systems

The following lemma is required.

Lemma 15.8 Let (  CÁ ²s³. Then the set
9 ~ ¸(&  &  s Á &  ¹
is a closed, convex cone.
Proof. We leave it as an exercise to prove that 9 is a convex cone and omit the
proof that 9 is closed.
Theorem 15.9 (Farkas's lemma) Let (  CÁ ²s³ and let   s be
nonzero. Then exactly one of the following holds:
1) There is a strictly positive solution "  s to the system (% ~  .
2) There is a vector #  s for which #(   and º#Á »  .
Proof. Suppose first that 1) holds. If 2) also holds, then
²#(³" ~ #²("³ ~ º#Á »  
However, #(   and "   imply that ²#(³"  . This contradiction implies
that 2) cannot hold.
Assume now that 1) fails to hold. By Lemma 15.8, the set
* ~ ¸(&  &  s Á &  ¹  s
is closed and convex. The fact that 1) fails to hold is equivalent to  ¤ * .
Hence, there is a hyperplane that strongly separates  and * . All we require is
that  and * be strictly separated, that is, for some   s and #  s ,
º#Á %»    º#Á » for all %  *
Since   * , it follows that    and so º#Á »  . Also, the first inequality is
equivalent to º#Á (&»  , that is,
º(! #Á &»  
for all &  s Á &  . We claim that this implies that (! # cannot have any
positive coordinates and thus #(  . For if the th coordinate ²(! #³ is
positive, then taking & ~  for    we get
²(! #³  
which does not hold for large . Thus, 2) holds.
In the exercises, we ask the reader to show that the previous result cannot be
improved by replacing #(   in statement 2) with #(  .

Chapter 16

Affine Geometry

In this chapter, we will study the geometry of a finite-dimensional vector space
= , along with its structure-preserving maps. Throughout this chapter, all vector
spaces are assumed to be finite-dimensional.

Affine Geometry
The cosets of a quotient space have a special geometric name.
Definition Let : be a subspace of a vector space = . The coset
# b : ~ ¸# b 

 :¹

is called a flat in = with base : and flat representative #. We also refer to
# b : as a translate of : . The set 7²= ³ of all flats in = is called the affine
geometry of = . The dimension dim²7²= ³³ of 7²= ³ is defined to be dim²= ³.
While a flat may have many flat representatives, it only has one base since
% b : ~ & b ; implies that %  & b ; and so % b : ~ & b ; ~ % b ; ,
whence : ~ ; .
Definition The dimension of a flat % b : is dim²:³. A flat of dimension  is
called a  -flat. A -flat is a point, a -flat is a line and a -flat is a plane. A flat
of dimension dim²7²= ³³ c  is called a hyperplane.
Definition Two flats ? ~ % b : and @ ~ & b ; are said to be parallel if
:  ; or ;  : . This is denoted by ?  @ .
We will denote subspaces of = by the letters :Á ; Á Ã and flats in = by
?Á @ Á Ã .
Here are some of the basic intersection properties of flats.

428

Advanced Linear Algebra

Theorem 16.1 Let : and ; be subspaces of = and let ? ~ % b : and
@ ~ & b ; be flats in = .
1) The following are equivalent:
a) some translate of ? is in @ : $ b ?  @ for some $  =
b) some translate of : is in ; : # b :  ; for some #  =
c) :  ;
2) The following are equivalent:
a) ? and @ are translates: $ b ? ~ @ for some $  =
b) : and ; are translates: # b : ~ ; for some #  =
c) : ~ ;
3) ? q @ £ JÁ :  ; ¯ ?  @
4) ? q @ £ JÁ : ~ ; ¯ ? ~ @
5) If ?  @ then ?  @ , @  ? or ? q @ ~ J
6) ?  @ if and only if some translation of one of these flats is contained in
the other.
Proof. If 1a) holds, then c& b $ b % b :  ; and so 1b) holds. If 1b) holds,
then #  ; and so : ~ ²# b :³ c #  ; and so 1c) holds. If 1c) holds, then
& c % b ? ~ & b :  & b ; ~ @ and so 1a) holds. Part 2) is proved in a
similar manner.
For part 3), :  ; implies that # b ?  @ for some #  = and so if
'  ? q @ then # b '  @ and so #  @ , which implies that ?  @ .
Conversely, if ?  @ then part 1) implies that :  ; . Part 4) follows similarly.
We leave proof of 5) and 6) to the reader.

Affine Combinations
Let ? be a nonempty subset of = . It is well known that
1) ? is a subspace of = if and only if ? is closed under linear combinations,
or equivalently, ? is closed under linear combinations of any two vectors
in ? .
2) The smallest subspace of = containing ? is the set of all linear
combinations of elements of ? . In different language, the linear hull of ?
is equal to the linear span of ? .
We wish to establish the corresponding properties of affine subspaces of = ,
beginning with the counterpart of a linear combination.
Definition Let = be a vector space and let %  = . A linear combination
 % b Ä b  %
where   - and  ~  is called an affine combination of the vectors % .
Let us refer to a nonempty subset ? of = as affine closed if ? is closed under
any affine combination of vectors in ? and two-affine closed if ? is closed

Affine Geometry

under affine combinations of any two vectors in ? . These are not standard
terms.
The line containing two distinct vectors %Á &  = is the set
%& ~ ¸% b ² c ³&    - ¹ ~ & b º% c &»
of all affine combinations of % and &. Thus, a subset ? of = is two-affine closed
if and only if ? contains the line through any two of its points.
Theorem 16.2 Let = be a vector space over a field - with char²- ³ £ . Then a
subset ? of = is affine closed if and only if it is two-affine closed.
Proof. The theorem is proved by induction on the number  of terms in an
affine combination. The case  ~  holds by assumption. Assume the result true
for affine combinations with fewer than    terms and consider the affine
combination
' ~  %  b Ä b   % 
where   . There are two cases to consider. If either of  and  is not equal
to , say  £ , write
' ~  % b ² c  ³>



% b Ä b
% ?
 c 
 c 

and if  ~  ~ , then since char²- ³ £ 2, we may write


' ~  > %  b %  ? b 3 % 3 b Ä b   % 


In either case, the inductive hypothesis applies to the expression inside the
square brackets and then to ' .
The requirement char²- ³ £  is necessary, for if - ~ { , then the subset
? ~ ¸²Á ³Á ²Á ³Á ²Á ³¹
of -  is two-affine closed but not affine closed. We can now characterize flats.
Theorem 16.3 A nonempty subset ? of a vector space = is a flat if and only if
? is affine closed. Moreover, if char²- ³ £ , then ? is a flat if and only if ? is
two-affine closed.
Proof. Let ? ~ % b : be a flat and let % ~ % b   ? , where   : . If
' ~ , then
  % ~   ²% b  ³ ~ % b     % b :

  b   ~  ²% c %³ b  ²% c %³ ~  % b  % c ² b  ³%
for %  ? . Since the sum of the coefficients of % , % and % in the last
expression is , it follows that
  b   b % ~  % b  % c ² b  c ³%  ?
and so   b    ? c % ~ : . Thus, : is a subspace of = and ? ~ % b : is
a flat. The rest follows from Theorem 16.2.

Affine Hulls
The following definition is the analog of the subspace spanned by a collection
of vectors.
Definition Let ? be a nonempty set of vectors in = .
1) The affine hull of ? , denoted by affhull²?³, is the smallest flat containing
?.
2) The affine span of ? , denoted by affspan²?³, is the set of all affine
combinations of vectors in ? .
Theorem 16.4 Let ? be a nonempty subset of = . Then
affhull²?³ ~ affspan²?³ ~ % b span²? c %³
or equivalently, for a subspace : of = ,
% b : ~ affspan²?³

¯

: ~ span²? c %³

Also,
dim²affspan²?³³ ~ dim²span²? c %³³
Proof. Theorem 16.3 implies that affspan²?³  affhull²?³ and so it is
sufficient to show that ( ~ affspan²?³ is a flat, or equivalently, that for any
&  (, the set : ~ ( c & is a subspace of = . To this end, let

which is in ( c & ~ : , since the last sum is an affine sum. Hence, : is a
subspace of = . We leave the rest of the proof to the reader.

The Lattice of Flats
The intersection of subspaces is a subspace, although it may be trivial. For flats,
if the intersection is not empty, then it is also a flat. However, since the
intersection of flats may be empty, the set 7²= ³ does not form a lattice under
intersection. However, we can easily fix this.
Theorem 16.5 Let = be a vector space. The set
7 ²= ³ ~ 7²= ³ r ¸J¹
of all flats in = , together with the empty set, is a complete lattice in which meet
is intersection. In particular:
1) 7 ²= ³ is closed under arbitrary intersection. In fact, if
< ~ ¸% b :    2¹ has nonempty intersection, then
<~
2

²% b : ³ ~ % b
2

:
2

for some %  < . In other words, the base of the intersection is the
intersection of the bases.
2) The join < of the family < ~ ¸% b :    2¹ is the intersection of all
flats containing the members of < . Also,
< ~ affhull4 < 5
3) If ? ~ % b : and @ ~ & b ; are flats in = , then
? v @ ~ % b ²º% c &» b : b ; ³
If ? q @ £ J, then
? v @ ~ % b ²: b ; ³
Proof. For part 1), if
%

²% b : ³

then % b : ~ % b : for all   2 and so

²% b : ³ ~

²% b : ³ ~ % b

We leave proof of part 2) to the reader.
For part 3), since %Á &  ? v @ , it follows that
?v@ ~%b< ~&b<
for some subspace < of = . Thus, % c &  < . Also, % b :  % b < implies that
:  < and similarly ;  < , whence : b ;  < and so if > ~
º% c &» b : b ; , then >  < . Hence, % b >  % b < ~ ? v @ . On the
other hand,
? ~%b: %b>
and
@ ~ & b ; ~ % c ²% c &³ b ;  % b >
and so ? v @  % b > . Thus, ? v @ ~ % b > .
If ? q @ £ J, then we may take the flat representatives for ? and @ to be any
element '  ? q @ , in which case part 1) gives
? v @ ~ ' b ²º' c '» b : b ; ³ ~ ' b : b ;
and since %  ? v @ , we also have ? v @ ~ % b : b ; .
We can now describe the dimension of the join of two flats.
Theorem 16.6 Let ? ~ % b : and @ ~ & b ; be flats in = .
1) If ? q @ £ J, then
dim²? v @ ³ ~ dim²: b ; ³ ~ dim²?³ b dim²@ ³ c dim²? q @ ³
2) If ? q @ ~ J, then
dim²? v @ ³ ~ dim²: b ; ³ b 
Proof. We have seen that if ? q @ £ J, then
?v@ ~%b: b;
and so
dim²? v @ ³ ~ dim²: b ; ³
On the other hand, if ? q @ ~ J, then
? v @ ~ % b ²º% c &» b : b ; ³
and since dim²º% c &»³ ~ , we get

Affine Geometry

433

dim²? v @ ³ ~ dim²: b ; ³ b 
Finally, we have
dim²: b ; ³ ~ dim²:³ b dim²; ³ c dim²: q ; ³
and Theorem 16.5 implies that
dim²? q @ ³ ~ dim²: q ; ³

Affine Independence
We now discuss the affine counterpart of linear independence.
Theorem 16.7 Let ? be a nonempty set of vectors in = . The following are
equivalent:
1) For all %  ? , the set
²? c %³ ± ¸¹
is linearly independent.
2) For all %  ? ,
% ¤ affhull²? ± ¸%¹³
3) For any vectors %  ? ,

5) When ? ~ ¸% Á Ã Á % ¹ is finite,
dim²affhull²?³³ ~  c 
A set ? of vectors satisfying any (any hence all) of these conditions is said to be
affinely independent.
Proof. If 1) holds but there is an affine combination equal to %,

where % £ % for all , then


  ²% c %³ ~ 

434

Advanced Linear Algebra

Since  is nonzero for some , this contradicts 1). Hence, 1) implies 2). Suppose
that 2) holds and
  % ~ 
where  ~ . If some  , say  , is nonzero then
% ~ c ² ° ³%  affhull²? ± ¸% ¹³


which contradicts 2) and so  ~  for all . Hence, 2) implies 3).
If 3) holds and the affine combinations satisfy
  % ~   %
then
 ² c  ³% ~ 
and since ² c  ³ ~  c  ~ , it follows that  ~  for all . Hence, 4)
holds. Thus, it is clear that 3) and 4) are equivalent. If 3) holds and
  ²% c %³ ~ 
for % £ % , then
  % c 4 5% ~ 
and so 3) implies that  ~  for all .
Finally, suppose that ? ~ ¸% Á Ã Á % ¹. Since
dim²affhull²?³³ ~ dim²º? c % »³
it follows that 5) holds if and only if ²? c % ³ ± ¸¹, which has size  c , is
linearly independent.
Affinely independent sets enjoy some of the basic properties of linearly
independent sets. For example, a nonempty subset of an affinely independent set
is affinely independent. Also, any nonempty set ? contains an affinely
independent set.
Since the affine hull / ~ affhull²?³ of an affinely independent set ? is not the
affine hull of any proper subset of ? , we deduce that ? is a minimal affine
spanning set of its affine hull.

Affine Bases and Barycentric Coordinates
We have seen that a set ? is affinely independent if and only if the set
?% ~ ²? c %³ ± ¸¹
is linearly independent. We have also seen that for a subsapce : of = ,
% b : ~ affspan²?³

¯

: ~ span²?% ³

Therefore, if by analogy, we define a subset 8 of a flat ( ~ % b : to be an
affine basis for ( if 8 is affinely independent and affspan²8 ³ ~ (, then 8 is an
affine basis for % b : if and only if 8% is a basis for : .
Theorem 16.8 Let ( ~ % b : be a flat of dimension . Let 8 ~ ²% Á Ã Á % ³ be
an ordered basis for : and let ²8 b %³ r ¸%¹ ~ ²% b %Á Ã Á % b %Á %³ be an
ordered affine basis for (. Then every #  ( has a unique expression as an
affine combination
# ~  % b Ä b  % b b %
The coefficients  are called the barycentric coordinates of # with respect to
the ordered affine basis 8 b %.
For example, in s , a plane is a flat of the form ( ~ % b º# Á # » where
8 ~ ²# Á # ³ is an ordered basis for a two-dimensional subspace of s . Then
²8 b %³ r ¸%¹ ~ ²# b %Á # b %Á %³ ~ ² Á  Á  ³
are barycentric coordinates for the plane, that is, any #  ( has the form

where  b  b  ~ .

We should mention that some authors require that  be bijective in order to be

Theorem 16.9 If char²- ³ £ , then a function  ¢ = ¦ = is an affine
transformation if and only if it preserves affine combinations of every pair of its
points, that is, if and only if
 ²% b ² c ³&³ ~  ²%³ b ² c ³ ²&³
Thus, if char²- ³ £ , then a map  is an affine transformation if and only if it
sends the line through % and & to the line through  ²%³ and  ²&³. It is clear that
linear transformations are affine transformations. So are the following maps.
Definition Let #  = . The affine map ;# ¢ = ¦ = defined by
;# ²%³ ~ % b #
for all %  = , is called translation by #.
It is not hard to see that any composition ;# k  , where   B²= ³, is affine.
Conversely, any affine map must have this form.
Theorem 16.10 A function  ¢ = ¦ = is an affine transformation if and only if
it is a linear operator followed by a translation,
 ~ ;# k 
where #  = and   B²= ³.
Proof. We leave proof that ;# k  is an affine transformation to the reader. Let 
be an affine map and suppose that   ~ c' . Then ;' k   ~ . Moreover,
letting  ~ ;' k  , we have
 ²" b #³ ~  ²" b #³ b '
~  ²" b # b ² c  c ³³ b '
~  " b  # c ² c  c ³' b '
~  " b  #
and so  is linear.
Corollary 16.11
1) The composition of two affine transformations is an affine transformation.
2) An affine transformation  ~ ;# k  is bijective if and only if  is bijective.
3) The set aff²= ³ of all bijective affine transformations on = is a group under
composition of maps, called the affine group of = .
Let us make a few group-theoretic remarks about aff²= ³. The set trans²= ³ of all
translations of = is a subgroup of aff²= ³. We can define a function
¢ aff²= ³ ¦ B²= ³ by
²;# k  ³ ~ 
