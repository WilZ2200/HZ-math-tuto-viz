0 ~ ¸  9  ² Á Ã Á c Á Á Á Ã Á ³  : for some  Á Ã Á c  9¹
Then it is easy to see that 0 is an ideal of 9 and so 0 ~ º » for some   9 .
Let
" ~ ² Á Ã Á c Á  Á Á Ã Á ³  :
We claim that
8 ~ ¸"   ~ Á Ã Á  and  £ ¹
is a basis for : . As to linear independence, suppose that
8 ~ ¸" Á Ã Á " ¹
and that
 " b Ä b  " ~ 
Then comparing the  th coordinates gives   ~  and since  £ , it
follows that  ~ . In a similar way, all coefficients are  and so 8 is linearly
independent.
To see that 8 spans : , we partition the elements %  : according to the largest
coordinate index ²%³ with nonzero entry and induct on ²%³. If ²%³ ~ , then
% ~ , which is in the span of 8 . Suppose that all %  : with ²%³   are in
the span of 8 and let ²%³ ~  , that is,
% ~ ² Á Ã Á  Á Á Ã Á ³
where  £ . Then   0 and so  £  and  ~  for some   9 .
Hence, ²% c " ³   and so & ~ % c "  ºº8»» and therefore %  ºº8»».
Thus, 8 is a basis for : .
The previous proof can be generalized in a more or less direct way to modules
of arbitrary rank. In this case, we may assume that 4 ~ ²9  ³ is the 9 -module
of functions with finite support from  to 9 , where  is a cardinal number. We
use the fact that  is a well-ordered set, that is,  is a totally ordered set in which
any nonempty subset has a smallest element. If   , the closed interval ´Á µ
is
´Á µ ~ ¸%      %  ¹
Let :  4 . For each     , let
4 ~ ¸  :  supp² ³  ´Á µ¹
Then the set
0 ~ ¸ ²³    4 ¹

is an ideal of 9 and so 0 ~ º ²³» for some   : . We show that
8 ~ ¸      Á  ²³ £ ¹
is a basis for : . First, suppose that
  b Ä b   ~ 
where    for   . Applying this to  gives
  ² ³ ~ 
and since 9 is an integral domain,  ~ . Similarly,  ~  for all  and so 8 is
linearly independent.
To show that 8 spans : , since any   : has finite support, there is a largest
index  ~ ² ³ for which  ² ³ £ . Now, if ºº8 »»  : , then since  is wellordered, we may choose a   : ± ºº8 »» for which  ~  ~ ²³ is as small as
possible. Then   4 . Moreover, since  £ ²³  0 , it follows that
 ²³ £  and ²³ ~  ²³ for some   9 . Then
supp² c  ³  ´Á µ
and
² c  ³²³ ~ ²³ c  ²³ ~ 
and so ² c  ³  , which implies that  c   ºº8 »». But then
 ~ ² c  ³ b   ºº8 »»
a contradiction. Thus, 8 is a basis for : .
In a vector space of dimension , any set of  linearly independent vectors is a
basis. This fails for modules. For example, { is a {-module of rank  but the
independent set ¸¹ is not a basis. On the other hand, the fact that a spanning set
of size  is a basis does hold for modules over a principal ideal domain, as we
now show.
Theorem 6.6 Let 4 be a free 9 -module of finite rank , where 9 is a principal
ideal domain. Let : ~ ¸  Á Ã Á  ¹ be a spanning set for 4 . Then : is a basis
for 4 .
Proof. Let 8 ~ ¸ Á Ã Á  ¹ be a basis for 4 and define the map  ¢ 4 ¦ 4 by
 ~  and extending to a surjective 9 -homomorphism. Since 4 is free,
Theorem 5.6 implies that
4  ker² ³ ^ im² ³ ~ ker² ³ ^ 4
Since ker² ³ is a submodule of the free module and since 9 is a principal ideal
domain, we know that ker² ³ is free of rank at most . It follows that

rk²4 ³ ~ rk²ker² ³³ b rk²4 ³
and so rk²ker² ³³ ~ , that is, ker² ³ ~ ¸¹, which implies that  is an 9 isomorphism and so : is a basis.
In general, a basis for a submodule of a free module over a principal ideal
domain cannot be extended to a basis for the entire module. For example, the set
¸¹ is a basis for the submodule { of the {-module {, but this set cannot be
extended to a basis for { itself. We state without proof the following result
along these lines.
Theorem 6.7 Let 4 be a free 9 -module of rank , where 9 is a principal ideal
domain. Let 5 be a submodule of 4 that is free of rank   . Then there is a
basis 8 for 4 that contains a subset : ~ ¸# Á Ã Á # ¹ for which
¸ # Á Ã Á  # ¹ is a basis for 5 , for some nonzero elements  Á Ã Á  of 9 .

Torsion-Free and Free Modules
Let us explore the relationship between the concepts of torsion-free and free. It
is not hard to see that any free module over an integral domain is torsion-free.
The converse does not hold, unless we strengthen the hypotheses by requiring
that the module be finitely generated.
Theorem 6.8 A finitely generated module over a principal ideal domain is free
if and only if it is torsion-free.
Proof. We leave proof that a free module over an integral domain is torsion-free
to the reader. Let . ~ ¸# Á Ã Á # ¹ be a generating set for 4 . Consider first the
case  ~ , whence . ~ ¸#¹. Then . is a basis for 4 since singleton sets are
linearly independent in a torsion-free module. Hence, 4 is free.
Now suppose that . ~ ¸"Á #¹ is a generating set with "Á # £ . If . is linearly
independent, we are done. If not, then there exist nonzero Á  9 for which
" ~ #. It follows that 4 ~ ºº"Á #»»  ºº"»» and so 4 is a submodule of a
free module and is therefore free by Theorem 6.5. But the map ¢ 4 ¦ 4
defined by # ~ # is an isomorphism because 4 is torsion-free. Thus 4 is
also free.
Now we can do the general case. Write
. ~ ¸" Á Ã Á " Á # Á Ã Á #c ¹
where : ~ ¸" Á Ã Á " ¹ is a maximal linearly independent subset of . . (Note
that : is nonempty because singleton sets are linearly independent.)
For each # , the set ¸" Á Ã Á " Á # ¹ is linearly dependent and so there exist
  9 and  Á Ã Á   9 for which

 # b  " b Ä b  " ~ 
If  ~  Äc , then
4 ~ ºº" Á Ã Á " Á # Á Ã Á #c »»  ºº" Á Ã Á " »»
and since the latter is a free module, so is 4 , and therefore so is 4 .

The Primary Cyclic Decomposition Theorem
The first step in the decomposition of a finitely generated module 4 over a
principal ideal domain 9 is an easy one.
Theorem 6.9 Any finitely generated module 4 over a principal ideal domain 9
is the direct sum of a finitely generated free 9 -module and a finitely generated
torsion 9 -module
4 ~ 4free l 4tor
The torsion part 4tor is unique, since it must be the set of all torsion elements of
4 , whereas the free part 4free is unique only up to isomorphism, that is, the
rank of the free part is unique.
Proof. It is easy to see that the set 4tor of all torsion elements is a submodule of
4 and the quotient 4 °4tor is torsion-free. Moreover, since 4 is finitely
generated, so is 4 °4tor . Hence, Theorem 6.8 implies that 4 °4tor is free.
Hence, Theorem 5.6 implies that
4 ~ 4tor l where -  4 °4tor is free.
As to the uniqueness of the torsion part, suppose that 4 ~ ; l . where ; is
torsion and . is free. Then ;  4tor . But if # ~ ! b   4tor for !  ; and
  ., then  ~ # c !  4tor and so  ~  and #  ; . Thus, ; ~ 4tor .
For the free part, since 4 ~ 4tor l - ~ 4tor l . , the submodules - and .
are both complements of 4tor and hence are isomorphic.
Note that if ¸$ Á Ã Á $ ¹ is a basis for 4free we can write
4 ~ ºº$ »» l Ä l ºº$ »» l 4tor
where each cyclic submodule ºº$ »» has zero annihilator. This is a partial
decomposition of 4 into a direct sum of cyclic submodules.

The Primary Decomposition
In view of Theorem 6.9, we turn our attention to the decomposition of finitely
generated torsion modules 4 over a principal ideal domain. The first step is to
decompose 4 into a direct sum of primary submodules, defined as follows.

Modules Over a Principal Ideal Domain

147

Definition Let  be a prime in 9 . A -primary (or just primary) module is a
module whose order is a power of .
Theorem 6.10 (The primary decomposition theorem) Let 4 be a torsion
module over a principal ideal domain 9 , with order
 ~  Ä
where the  's are distinct nonassociate primes in 9 .
1) 4 is the direct sum
4 ~ 4  l Ä l 4  
where
4  ~


4 ~ ¸#  4   # ~ ¹


is a primary submodule of order  . This decomposition of 4 into primary
submodules is called the primary decomposition of 4 .
2) The primary decomposition of 4 is unique up to order of the summands.
That is, if
4 ~ 5 l Ä l 5
where 5 is primary of order  and  Á Ã Á  are distinct nonassociate
primes, then  ~  and, after a possible reindexing, 5 ~ 4 . Hence,
 ~  and    , for  ~ Á Ã Á .
3) Two 9 -modules 4 and 5 are isomorphic if and only if the summands in
their primary decompositions are pairwise isomorphic, that is, if
4 ~ 4  l Ä l 4  
and
5 ~ 5 l Ä l 5
are primary decompositions, then  ~  and, after a possible reindexing,
4  5 for  ~ Á Ã Á .
Proof. Let us write  ~ ° and show first that
4  ~   4 ~ ¸   #  #  4 ¹
Since  ² 4 ³ ~ 4 ~ ¸¹, we have  4  4 . On the other hand, since
 and  are relatively prime, there exist Á   9 for which
 b  ~ 
and so if %  4 then

148

Advanced Linear Algebra

% ~ ² b  ³% ~  %   4
Hence 4 ~  4 .
For part 1), since gcd² Á Ã Á  ³ ~ , there exist scalars  for which
  b Ä b   ~ 
and so for any %  4 ,


% ~ ²  b Ä b   ³%    4
~

Moreover, since the ² 4 ³   and the  's are pairwise relatively prime, it
follows that the sum of the submodules  4 is direct, that is,
4 ~   4 l Ä l   4 ~ 4  l Ä l 4  
As to the annihilators, it is clear that º »  ann² 4 ³. For the reverse
inclusion, if   ann² 4 ³, then   ann²4 ³ and so     , that is,
   and so   º ». Thus ann² 4 ³ ~ º ».

As to uniqueness, we claim that  ~  Ä
is an order of 4 . It is clear that 
annihilates 4 and so    . On the other hand, 5 contains an element " of
order  and so the sum # ~ " b Ä b " has order  , which implies that
  . Hence,  and  are associates.

Unique factorization in 9 now implies that  ~  and, after a suitable
reindexing, that  ~  and  and  are associates. Hence, 5 is primary of
order  . For convenience, we can write 5 as 5 . Hence,
5  ¸#  4   # ~ ¹ ~ 4
But if
5 l Ä l 5 ~ 4 l Ä l 4
and 5  4 for all , we must have 5 ~ 4 for all .
For part 3), if  ~  and  ¢ 4  5 , then the map ¢ 4 ¦ 5 defined by
² b Ä b  ³ ~  ² ³ b Ä b  ² ³
is an isomorphism and so 4  5 . Conversely, suppose that ¢ 4  5 . Then
4 and 5 have the same annihilators and therefore the same order
 ~  Ä
Hence, part 1) and part 2) imply that  ~  and after a suitable reindexing,

149

 ~  . Moreover, since
  4 ¯   ~  ¯ ² ³ ~  ¯   ~  ¯   5
it follows that ¢ 4  5 .

The Cyclic Decomposition of a Primary Module
The next step in the decomposition process is to show that a primary module
can be decomposed into a direct sum of cyclic submodules. While this
decomposition is not unique (see the exercises), the set of annihilators is unique,
as we will see. To establish this uniqueness, we use the following result.
Lemma 6.11 Let 4 be a module over a principal ideal domain 9 and let
  9 be a prime.
1) If 4 ~ ¸¹, then 4 is a vector space over the field 9°º» with scalar
multiplication defined by
² b º»³# ~ #
for all #  4 .
2) For any submodule : of 4 the set
: ²³ ~ ¸#  :  # ~ ¹
is also a submodule of 4 and if 4 ~ : l ; , then
4 ²³ ~ : ²³ l ; ²³
Proof. For part 1), since  is prime, the ideal º» is maximal and so 9°º» is a
field. We leave the proof that 4 is a vector space over 9°º» to the reader. For
part 2), it is straightforward to show that : ²³ is a submodule of 4 . Since
: ²³  : and ; ²³  ; we see that : ²³ q ; ²³ ~ ¸¹. Also, if #  4 ²³ , then
# ~ . But # ~ b ! for some  : and !  ; and so  ~ # ~  b !.
Since   : and !  ; we deduce that  ~ ! ~ , whence #  : ²³ l ; ²³ .
Thus, 4 ²³  : ²³ l ; ²³ . But the reverse inequality is manifest.
Theorem 6.12 (The cyclic decomposition theorem of a primary module) Let
4 be a primary finitely generated torsion module over a principal ideal domain
9 , with order  .
1) 4 is a direct sum
4 ~ ºº# »» l Ä l ºº# »»

(6.1)

of cyclic submodules with annihilators ann²ºº# »»³ ~ º », which can be
arranged in ascending order
ann²ºº# »»³  Ä  ann²ºº# »»³

150

or equivalently,
 ~      Ä   

2) As to uniqueness, suppose that 4 is also the direct sum
4 ~ ºº" »» l Ä l ºº" »»
of cyclic submodules with annihilators ann²ºº" »»³ ~ º  », arranged in
ascending order
ann²ºº" »»³  Ä  ann²ºº" »»³
or equivalently
     Ä   
Then the two chains of annihilators are identical, that is,  ~  and
ann²ºº" »»³ ~ ann²ºº# »»³
for all . Thus,    and  ~  for all .
3) Two -primary 9 -modules
4 ~ ºº# »» l Ä l ºº# »»
and
5 ~ ºº" »» l Ä l ºº" »»
are isomorphic if and only if they have the same annihilator chains, that is,
if and only if  ~  and, after a possible reindexing,
ann²ºº" »»³ ~ ann²ºº# »»³
Proof. Let #  4 have order equal to the order of 4 , that is,
ann²# ³ ~ ann²4 ³ ~ º »
Such an element must exist since ²# ³   for all #  4 and if this inequality
is strict, then c will annihilate 4 .
If we show that ºº# »» is complemented, that is, 4 ~ ºº# »» l : for some
submodule : , then since : is also a finitely generated primary torsion module
over 9, we can repeat the process to get
4 ~ ºº# »» l ºº# »» l :
where ann²# ³ ~ º ». We can continue this decomposition:
4 ~ ºº# »» l ºº# »» l Ä l ºº# »» l :
as long as : £ ¸¹. But the ascending sequence of submodules

Modules Over a Principal Ideal Domain

151

ºº# »»  ºº# »» l ºº# »»  Ä
must terminate since 4 is Noetherian and so there is an integer  for which
eventually : ~ ¸¹, giving (6.1).
Let # ~ # . The direct sum 4 ~ ºº#»» l ¸¹ clearly exists. Suppose that the
direct sum
4 ~ ºº#»» l :
exists. We claim that if 4  4 , then it is possible to find a submodule :b
for which :  :b and for which the direct sum 4b ~ ºº#»» l :b also
exists. This process must also stop after a finite number of steps, giving
4 ~ ºº#»» l : as desired.
If 4  4 and "  4 ± 4 let
:b ~ ºº: Á " c #»»
for   9. Then :  :b since " ¤ 4 . We wish to show that for some
  9, the direct sum
ºº#»» l :b
exists, that is,
%  ºº#»» q ºº: Á " c #»» ¬ % ~ 
Now, there exist scalars  and  for which
% ~ # ~ b ²" c #³
for  : and so if we find a scalar  for which
²" c #³  :

(6.2)

then ºº#»» q : ~ ¸¹ implies that % ~  and the proof of existence will be
complete.
Solving for " gives
" ~ ² b ³# c  ºº#»» l : ~ 4
so let us consider the ideal of all such scalars:
? ~ ¸  9  "  4 ¹
Since   ? and ? is principal, we have
? ~ º »
for some   . Also,    since " ¤ 4 implies that  ¤ ? .

152

Advanced Linear Algebra

Since   ? , we have  ~   and there exist   9 and !  : for which
 " ~ # b !
Hence,
" ~   " ~  ²# b !³ ~  # b  !
Now we need more information about . Multiplying the expression for  " by
c gives
 ~  " ~ c ² "³ ~ c # b c !
and since ºº#»» q : ~ ¸¹, it follows that c # ~ . Hence,   c  , that
is,    and so  ~   for some   9 . Now we can write
" ~   # b  !
and so
²" c  #³ ~  !  :
Thus, we take  ~  to get (6.2) and that completes the proof of existence.
For uniqueness, note first that 4 has orders  and   and so  and  are
associates and  ~  . Next we show that  ~ . According to part 2) of
Lemma 6.10,
4 ²³ ~ ºº# »»²³ l Ä l ºº# »»²³
and
4 ²³ ~ ºº" »»²³ l Ä l ºº" »»²³
where all summands are nonzero. Since 4 ²³ ~ ¸¹, it follows from Lemma
6.10 that 4 ²³ is a vector space over 9°º» and so each of the preceding
decompositions expresses 4 ²³ as a direct sum of one-dimensional vector
subspaces. Hence,  ~ dim²4 ²³ ³ ~ .
Finally, we show that the exponents  and  are equal using induction on  . If
 ~ , then  ~  for all  and since  ~  , we also have  ~  for all .
Suppose the result is true whenever    c  and let  ~  . Write
² Á Ã Á  ³ ~ ² Á Ã Á  Á Á Ã Á ³Á   
and
² Á Ã Á  ³ ~ ² Á Ã Á ! Á Á Ã Á ³Á !  

Then

1) If 4 has order

c) For each primary submodule pair 5 ~ 4 , the cyclic submodules
have the same annihilator chains; that is, after possible reindexing,
ann²ºº"Á »»³ ~ ann²ºº#Á »»³
for all Á .
In summary, the primary submodules and annihilator chains are uniquely
determined by the module 4 .
3) Two 9 -modules 4 and 5 are isomorphic if and only if they have the same
annihilator chains.

Elementary Divisors
Since the chain of annihilators



is unique except for order, the multiset ¸ Á ¹ of generators is uniquely

determined up to associate. The generators  Á are called the elementary

divisors of 4 . Note that for each prime  , the elementary divisor  Á of largest
exponent is precisely the factor of ²4 ³ associated to  .
Let us write ElemDiv²4 ³ to denote the multiset of all elementary divisors of
4 . Thus, if   ElemDiv²4 ³, then any associate of  is also in ElemDiv²4 ³.
We can now say that ElemDiv²4 ³ is a complete invariant for isomorphism.
Technically, the function 4 ª ElemDiv²4 ³ is the complete invariant, but this
hair is not worth splitting. Also, we could work with a system of distinct
representatives for the associate classes of the elementary divisors, but in
general, there is no way to single out a special representative.
Theorem 6.14 Let 9 be a principal ideal domain. The multiset ElemDiv²4 ³ is
a complete invariant for isomorphism of finitely generated torsion 9 -modules,
that is,

ElemDiv²4 ³ ~ ElemDiv²5 ³

We have seen (Theorem 6.2) that if
4 ~(l)
then
²4 ³ ~ lcm²²(³Á ²)³³
Let us now compare the elementary divisors of 4 to those of ( and ) .
Theorem 6.15 Let 4 be a finitely generated torsion module over a principal

1) The primary cyclic decomposition of 4 is the direct sum of the primary

is the primary cyclic decomposition of M.

2) The elementary divisors of 4 are
ElemDiv²4 ³ ~ ElemDiv²(³ r ElemDiv²)³
where the union is a multiset union; that is, we keep all duplicate
members.

The Invariant Factor Decomposition
According to Theorem 6.4, if : and ; are cyclic submodules with relatively
prime orders, then : l ; is a cyclic submodule whose order is the product of
the orders of : and ; . Accordingly, in the primary cyclic decomposition of 4 ,
4 ~ ´ ºº#Á »» l Ä

with elementary divisors  Á satisfying
(6.3)

 ~ Á  Á  Ä  Á

we can combine cyclic summands with relatively prime orders. One judicious
way to do this is to take the leftmost (highest-order) cyclic submodules from
each group to get
+ ~ ºº#Á »» l Ä l ºº#Á »»
and repeat the process
+ ~ ºº#Á »» l Ä l ºº#Á »»

Of course, some summands may be missing here since different primary
modules 4 do not necessarily have the same number of summands. In any
case, the result of this regrouping and combining is a decomposition of the form
4 ~ + l Ä l +
which is called an invariant factor decomposition of 4 .
For example, suppose that
4 ~ ´ºº#Á »» l ºº#Á »»µ l ´ºº#Á »»µ l ´ºº#Á »» l ºº#Á»» l ºº#Á»»µ

As to the orders of the summands, referring to (6.3), if + has order  , then

(6.4)

  c  Ä    
or equivalently,
ann²+ ³  ann²+ ³  Ä
The numbers  are called invariant factors of the decomposition.
For instance, in the example above suppose that the elementary divisors are
 Á  Á  Á  Á  Á 
Then the invariant factors are
 ~   
 ~  
 ~  


The process described above that passes from a sequence  Á of elementary
divisors in order (6.3) to a sequence of invariant factors in order (6.4) is
reversible. The inverse process takes a sequence  Á Ã Á  satisfying (6.4),
factors each  into a product of distinct nonassociate prime powers with the
primes in the same order and then “peels off” like prime powers from the left.
(The reader may wish to try it on the example above.)
This fact, together with Theorem 6.4, implies that primary cyclic
decompositions and invariant factor decompositions are essentially equivalent.
Therefore, since the multiset of elementary divisors of 4 is unique up to
associate, the multiset of invariant factors of 4 is also unique up to associate.
Furthermore, the multiset of invariant factors is a complete invariant for
isomorphism.
Theorem 6.16 (The invariant factor decomposition theorem) Let 4 be a
finitely generated torsion module over a principal ideal domain 9 . Then
4 ~ + l Ä l +
where D is a cyclic submodule of 4 , with order  , where
  c  Ä    
This decomposition is called an invariant factor decomposition of 4 and the
scalars  are called the invariant factors of 4 .
1) The multiset of invariant factors is uniquely determined up to associate by
the module 4 .
2) The multiset of invariant factors is a complete invariant for isomorphism.
The annihilators of an invariant factor decomposition are called the invariant
ideals of 4 . The chain of invariant ideals is unique, as is the chain of

annihilators in the primary cyclic decomposition. Note that  is an order of 4 ,
that is,
ann²4 ³ ~ º »
Note also that the product
 ~  Ä
of the invariant factors of 4 has some nice properties. For example,  is the
product of all the elementary divisors of 4 . We will see in a later chapter that
in the context of a linear operator  on a vector space,  is the characteristic
polynomial of  .

Characterizing Cyclic Modules
The primary cyclic decomposition can be used to characterize cyclic modules
via their elementary divisors.
Theorem 6.17 Let 4 be a finitely generated torsion module over a principal
ideal domain, with order
 ~  Ä
The following are equivalent:
1) 4 is cyclic.
2) 4 is the direct sum
4 ~ ºº# »» l Ä l ºº# »»
of primary cyclic submodules ºº# »» of order  .
3) The elementary divisors of 4 are precisely the prime power factors of :
ElemDiv²4 ³ ~ ¸ Á Ã Á  ¹
Proof. Suppose that 4 is cyclic. Then the primary decomposition of 4 is a
primary cyclic decomposition, since any submodule of a cyclic module is cyclic.
Hence, 1) implies 2). Conversely, if 2) holds, then since the orders are relatively
prime, Theorem 6.4 implies that 4 is cyclic. We leave the rest of the proof to
the reader.

Indecomposable Modules
The primary cyclic decomposition of 4 is a decomposition of 4 into a direct
sum of submodules that cannot be further decomposed. In fact, this
characterizes the primary cyclic decomposition of 4 . Before justifying these
statements, we make the following definition.
Definition A module 4 is indecomposable if it cannot be written as a direct
sum of proper submodules.

Modules Over a Principal Ideal Domain

159

We leave proof of the following as an exercise.
Theorem 6.18 Let 4 be a finitely generated torsion module over a principal
ideal domain. The following are equivalent:
1) 4 is indecomposable
2) 4 is primary cyclic
3) 4 has only one elementary divisor:
ElemDiv²4 ³ ~ ¸ ¹
Thus, the primary cyclic decomposition of 4 is a decomposition of 4 into a
direct sum of indecomposable modules. Conversely, if
4 ~ ( l Ä l (
is a decomposition of 4 into a direct sum of indecomposable submodules, then
each submodule ( is primary cyclic and so this is the primary cyclic
decomposition of 4 .

Indecomposable Submodules of Prime Order
Readers acquainted with group theory know that any group of prime order is
cyclic. However, as mentioned earlier, the order of a module corresponds to the
smallest exponent of a group, not to the order of a group. Indeed, there are
modules of prime order that are not cyclic. Nevertheless, cyclic modules of
prime order are important.
Indeed, if 4 is a finitely generated torsion module over a principal ideal
domain, with order , then each prime factor  of  gives rise to a cyclic
submodule > of 4 whose order is  and so > is also indecomposable.
Unfortunately, > need not be complemented and so we cannot use it to
decompose 4 . Nevertheless, the theorem is still useful, as we will see in a later
chapter.
Theorem 6.19 Let 4 be a finitely generated torsion module over a principal
ideal domain, with order . If  is a prime divisor of , then 4 has a cyclic
(equivalently, indecomposable) submodule > of prime order .
Proof. If  ~  , then there is a #  4 for which $ ~ # £  but $ ~ .
Then > ~ ºº$»» is annihilated by  and so ²$³  . But  is prime and
²$³ £  and so ²$³ ~ . Since > has prime order, Theorem 6.18 implies
that > is cyclic if and only if it is indecomposable.

The Structure of a Linear Operator

In this chapter, we study the structure of a linear operator on a finitedimensional vector space, using the powerful module decomposition theorems
of the previous chapter. Unless otherwise noted, all vector spaces will be
assumed to be finite-dimensional.
Let = be a finite-dimensional vector space. Let us recall two earler theorems
(Theorem 2.19 and Theorem 2.20).
Theorem 7.1 Let = be a vector space of dimension .
1) Two  d  matrices ( and ) are similar (written (  ) ) if and only if
they represent the same linear operator   B²= ³, but possibly with
respect to different ordered bases. In this case, the matrices ( and )
represent exactly the same set of linear operators in B²= ³.
2) Then two linear operators  and  on = are similar (written   ) if and
only if there is a matrix (  C that represents both operators, but with
respect to possibly different ordered bases. In this case,  and  are
represented by exactly the same set of matrices in C .
Theorem 7.1 implies that the matrices that represent a given linear operator are
precisely the matrices that lie in one similarity class. Hence, in order to uniquely
represent all linear operators on = , we would like to find a set consisting of one
simple representative of each similarity class, that is, a set of simple canonical
forms for similarity.
One of the simplest types of matrix is the diagonal matrix. However, these are
too simple, since some operators cannot be represented by a diagonal matrix. A
less simple type of matrix is the upper triangular matrix. However, these are not
simple enough: Every operator (over an algebraically closed field) can be
represented by an upper triangular matrix but some operators can be represented
by more than one upper triangular matrix.

164

Advanced Linear Algebra

This gives rise to two different directions for further study. First, we can search
for a characterization of those linear operators that can be represented by
diagonal matrices. Such operators are called diagonalizable. Second, we can
search for a different type of “simple” matrix that does provide a set of
canonical forms for similarity. We will pursue both of these directions.

The Module Associated with a Linear Operator
If   B²= ³, we will think of = not only as a vector space over a field - but
also as a module over - ´%µ, with scalar multiplication defined by
²%³# ~ ² ³²#³
We will write = to indicate the dependence on  . Thus, = and = are modules
with the same ring of scalars - ´%µ, although with different scalar multiplication
if  £ .
Our plan is to interpret the concepts of the previous chapter for the module = .
First, if dim²= ³ ~ , then dim²B²= ³³ ~  . This implies that = is a torsion
module. In fact, the  b  vectors


Á  Á   Á Ã Á  

are linearly dependent in B²= ³, which implies that ² ³ ~  for some nonzero
polynomial ²%³  - ´%µ. Hence, ²%³  ann²= ³ and so ann²= ³ is a nonzero
principal ideal of - ´%µ.
Also, since = is finitely generated as a vector space, it is, a fortiori, finitely
generated as an - ´%µ-module. Thus, = is a finitely generated torsion module
over a principal ideal domain - ´%µ and so we may apply the decomposition
theorems of the previous chapter. In the first part of this chapter, we embark on
a “translation project” to translate the powerful results of the previous chapter
into the language of the modules = .
Let us first characterize when two modules = and = are isomorphic.
Theorem 7.2 If  Á   B²= ³, then
=  =

¯

 

In particular, ¢ = ¦ = is a module isomorphism if and only if  is a vector
space automorphism of = satisfying
 ~ c
Proof. Suppose that ¢ = ¦ = is a module isomorphism. Then for #  = ,
²%#³ ~ %²#³
which is equivalent to

The Structure of a Linear Operator

165

² #³ ~ ²#³
and since  is bijective, this is equivalent to
²c ³# ~ #
that is,  ~ c . Since a module isomorphism from = to = is a vector space
isomorphism as well, the result follows.
For the converse, suppose that  is a vector space automorphism of = and
 ~ c , that is,  ~ . Then
²% #³ ~ ²  #³ ~  ²#³ ~ % ²#³
and the - -linearity of  implies that for any polynomial ²%³  - ´%µ,
²² ³#³ ~ ²³#
Hence,  is a module isomorphism from = to = .

Submodules and Invariant Subspaces
There is a simple connection between the submodules of the - ´%µ-module =
and the subspaces of the vector space = . Recall that a subspace : of = is  invariant if :  : .
Theorem 7.3 A subset :  = is a submodule of = if and only if : is a  invariant subspace of = .

Orders and the Minimal Polynomial
We have seen that the annihilator of = ,
ann²= ³ ~ ¸²%³  - ´%µ  ²%³= ~ ¸¹¹
is a nonzero principal ideal of - ´%µ, say
ann²= ³ ~ º²%³»
Since the elements of the base ring - ´%µ of = are polynomials, for the first time
in our study of modules there is a logical choice among all scalars in a given
associate class: Each associate class contains exactly one monic polynomial.
Definition Let   B²= ³. The unique monic order of = is called the minimal
polynomial for  and is denoted by  ²%³ or min² ³. Thus,
ann²= ³ ~ º ²%³»
In treatments of linear algebra that do not emphasize the role of the module = ,
the minimal polynomial of a linear operator  is simply defined as the unique

166

Advanced Linear Algebra

monic polynomial  ²%³ of smallest degree for which  ² ³ ~ . This
definition is equivalent to our definition.
The concept of minimal polynomial is also defined for matrices. The minimal
polynomial A ²%³ of matrix (  C ²- ³ is defined as the minimal polynomial
of the multiplication operator ( . Equivalently, ( ²%³ is the unique monic
polynomial ²%³  - ´%µ of smallest degree for which ²(³ ~ .
Theorem 7.4
1) If    are similar linear operators on = , then  ²%³ ~  ²%³. Thus, the
minimal polynomial is an invariant under similarity of operators.
2) If (  ) are similar matrices, then ( ²%³ ~ ) ²%³. Thus, the minimal
polynomial is an invariant under similarity of matrices.
3) The minimal polynomial of   B²= ³ is the same as the minimal
polynomial of any matrix that represents  .

Cyclic Submodules and Cyclic Subspaces
Let us now look at the cyclic submodules of = :
ºº#»» ~ - ´%µ# ~ ¸² ³²#³  ²%³  - ´%µ¹
which are  -invariant subspaces of = . Let ²%³ be the minimal polynomial of
Oºº#»» and suppose that deg²²%³³ ~ . If ²%³#  ºº#»», then writing
²%³ ~ ²%³²%³ b ²%³
where deg ²%³  deg ²%³ gives
²%³# ~ ´²%³²%³ b ²%³µ# ~ ²%³#
and so
ºº#»» ~ ¸²%³#  deg ²%³  ¹
Hence, the set
8 ~ ¸#Á %#Á Ã Á %c #¹ ~ ¸#Á  #Á Ã Á  c #¹
spans the vector space ºº#»». To see that 8 is a basis for ºº#»», note that any linear
combination of the vectors in 8 has the form ²%³# for deg²²%³³   and so is
equal to  if and only if ²%³ ~ . Thus, 8 is an ordered basis for ºº#»».
Definition Let   B²= ³. A  -invariant subspace : of = is  -cyclic if : has a
basis of the form
8 ~ ¸#Á  #Á Ã Á  c #¹
for some #  = and   . The basis 8 is called a  -cyclic basis for = .
