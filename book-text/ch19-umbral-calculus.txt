to knowing the polynomials  ²%³. Moreover, a knowledge of the generating
function of a sequence of polynomials can often lead to a deeper understanding
of the sequence itself, that might not be otherwise easily accessible. For this
reason, generating functions are studied quite extensively.
For the proofs of the following characterizations, we refer the reader to Roman
´1984µ.

Proof. To prove part 1), if  ²%³ is an associated sequence, then taking
²!³ ~ &! in Theorem 19.13 gives the binomial identity. Conversely, suppose
that the sequence  ²%³ is of binomial type. We will use the operator
characterization to show that  ²%³ is an associated sequence. Taking
% ~ & ~  we have for  ~ ,
 ²³ ~  ²³ ²³
and so  ²³ ~ . Also,

Next, define a linear functional  ²!³ by

Since º ²!³  » ~ º ²!³   ²%³» ~  and º ²!³  ²%³» ~  £  we deduce
that  ²!³ is a delta series. Now, the binomial identity gives

and since this holds for all &, we get  ²!³ ²%³ ~ c ²%³. Thus,  ²%³ is the
associated sequence for  ²!³.
For part 2), if  ²%³ is a Sheffer sequence, then taking ²!³ ~ &! in Theorem
19.13 gives the Sheffer identity. Conversely, suppose that the Sheffer identity
holds, where  ²%³ is the associated sequence for  ²!³. It suffices to show that
²!³  ²%³ ~  ²%³ for some invertible ²!³. Define a linear operator ; by

and the two are equal by part 1). Hence, ; commutes with &! and is therefore

Examples of Sheffer Sequences
We can now give some examples of Sheffer sequences. While it is often a
relatively straightforward matter to verify that a given sequence is Sheffer for a
given pair ²²!³Á  ²!³³, it is quite another matter to find the Sheffer sequence for
a given pair. The umbral calculus provides two formulas for this purpose, one of
which is direct, but requires the usually very difficult computation of the series
² ²!³°!³c . The other is a recurrence relation that expresses each  ²%³ in terms
of previous terms in the Sheffer sequence. Unfortunately, space does not permit
us to discuss these formulas in detail. However, we will discuss the recurrence
formula for associated sequences later in this chapter.

series  ²!³ ~ !. The generating function for this sequence is

As with the Hermite polynomials, some definitions of the Laguerre polynomials
differ by a multiplicative constant.
We presume that the few examples we have given here indicate that the umbral
calculus applies to a significant range of important polynomial sequences. In
Roman ´1984µ, we discuss approximately 30 different sequences of polynomials
that are (or are closely related to) Sheffer sequences.

Umbral Operators and Umbral Shifts
We have now established the basic framework of the umbral calculus. As we
have seen, the umbral algebra plays three roles: as the algebra of formal power
series in a single variable, as the algebra of all linear functionals on F and as the

The Umbral Calculus

491

algebra of all linear operators on F that commute with the derivative operator.
Moreover, since < is an algebra, we can consider geometric sequences
Á  Á   Á   Á Ã
in < , where ²³ ~  and ² ³ ~ . We have seen by example that the
orthogonality conditions
º²!³  ²!³ 

 ²%³» ~ [Á

define important families of polynomial sequences.
While the machinery that we have developed so far does unify a number of
topics from the classical study of polynomial sequences (for example, special
cases of the expansion theorem include Taylor's expansion, the Euler–
MacLaurin formula and Boole's summation formula), it does not provide much
new insight into their study. Our plan now is to take a brief look at some of the
deeper results in the umbral calculus, which center on the interplay between
operators on F and their adjoints, which are operators on the umbral algebra
< ~ F i.
We begin by defining two important operators on F associated with each
Sheffer sequence.
Definition Let  ²%³ be Sheffer for ²²!³Á  ²!³³. The linear operator
Á ¢ F ¦ F defined by
Á ²% ³ ~

 ²%³

is called the Sheffer operator for the pair ²²!³Á  ²!³³, or for the sequence
 ²%³. If  ²%³ is the associated sequence for  ²!³, the Sheffer operator
 ²% ³ ~  ²%³
is called the umbral operator for  ²!³, or for  ²%³.
Definition Let  ²%³ be Sheffer for ²²!³Á  ²!³³. The linear operator
Á ¢ F ¦ F defined by
Á ´  ²%³µ ~

is called the umbral shift for  ²!³, or for  ²%³.

 ²%³. If

It is clear that each Sheffer sequence uniquely determines a Sheffer operator and
vice versa. Hence, knowing the Sheffer operator of a sequence is equivalent to
knowing the sequence.

Continuous Operators on the Umbral Algebra
It is clearly desirable that a linear operator ; on the umbral algebra < pass
under infinite sums, that is, that
B

(19.6)

~

whenever the sum on the left is defined, which is precisely when ² ²!³³ ¦ B
as  ¦ B. Not all operators on < have this property, which leads to the
following definition.
Definition A linear operator ; on the umbral algebra < is continuous if it
satisfies ²19.6).
The term continuous can be justified by defining a topology on < . However,
since no additional topological concepts will be needed, we will not do so here.
Note that in order for (19.6) to make sense, we must have ²; ´ ²!³µ³ ¦ B. It
turns out that this condition is also sufficient.
Theorem 19.15 A linear operator ; on < is continuous if and only if
(19.7)

² ³ ¦ B ¬ ²; ² ³³ ¦ B

Proof. The necessity is clear. Suppose that (19.7) holds and that ² ³ ¦ B.

Operator Adjoints
If  ¢ F ¦ F is a linear operator on F , then its (operator) adjoint  d is an
operator on F i ~ < defined by
 d ´²!³µ ~ ²!³ k 
In the symbolism of the umbral calculus, this is
º d ²!³  ²%³» ~ º²!³   ²%³»
(We have reduced the number of parentheses used to aid clarity.³
Let us recall the basic properties of the adjoint from Chapter 3.
Theorem 19.16 For  Á   B²F ³,
1) ² b ³d ~  d b d
2) ² ³d ~  d for any   d
3) ²³d ~ d  d
4) ² c ³d ~ ² d ³c for any invertible   B²F ³
Thus, the map ¢ B²F ³ ¦ B²< ³ that sends  ¢ F ¦ F to its adjoint  d ¢ < ¦ <
is a linear transformation from B²F ³ to B²< ³. Moreover, since  d ~  implies
that º²!³   ²%³» ~  for all ²!³  < and ²%³  F , which in turn implies
that  ~ , we deduce that  is injective. The next theorem describes the range
of .
Theorem 19.17 A linear operator ;  B²< ³ is the adjoint of a linear operator
B  B²F ³ if and only if ; is continuous.
Proof. First, suppose that ; ~  d for some   B²F ³ and let ² ²!³³ ¦ B. If
  , then for all      we have
º d  ²!³  % » ~ º ²!³   % »
and so it is only necessary to take  large enough that ² ²!³³  deg  ²% ³ for
all     , whence

494

Advanced Linear Algebra

º d  ²!³  % » ~ 
for all      and so ² d  ²!³³  . Thus, ² d  ²!³³ ¦ B and  d is
continuous.
For the converse, assume that ; is continuous. If ; did have the form  d , then
º; !  % » ~ º d !  % » ~ º!   % »
and since

we are prompted to define  by

This makes sense since ²; ! ³ ¦ B as  ¦ B and so the sum on the right is a

[

º d !  % » ~ º!   % » ~ 

which implies that ; ! ~  d ! for all   . Finally, since ; and  d are both
continuous, we have ; ~  d .

Umbral Operators and Automorphisms of the Umbral Algebra
Figure 19.1 shows the map , which is an isomorphism from the vector space
B²F ³ onto the space of all continuous linear operators on < . We are interested
in determining the images under this isomorphism of the set of umbral operators
and the set of umbral shifts, as pictured in Figure 19.1.

The Umbral Calculus

Figure 19.1
Let us begin with umbral operators. Suppose that  is the umbral operator for
the associated sequence  ²%³, with delta series  ²!³  < . Then
ºd  ²!³  % » ~ º ²!³   % » ~ º ²!³   ²%³» ~ [Á ~ º!  %»
for all  and . Hence, d  ²!³ ~ ! and the continuity of d implies that
d ! ~  ²!³
More generally, for any ²!³  < ,
d ²!³ ~ ² ²!³³

(19.9)

In words, d is composition by  ²!³.
From (19.9), we deduce that d is a vector space isomorphism and that
d ´²!³²!³µ ~ ² ²!³³² ²!³³ ~ d ²!³d²!³
Hence, d is an automorphism of the umbral algebra < . It is a pleasant fact that
this characterizes umbral operators. The first step in the proof of this is the
following, whose proof is left as an exercise.
Theorem 19.18 If ; is an automorphism of the umbral algebra, then ;
preserves order, that is, ²;  ²!³³ ~ ² ²!³³. In particular, ; is continuous.
Theorem 19.19 A linear operator  on F is an umbral operator if and only if
its adjoint is an automorphism of the umbral algebra < . Moreover, if  is an
umbral operator, then

496

d ²!³ ~ ² ²!³³
for all ²!³  < . In particular, d  ²!³ ~ !.
Proof. We have already shown that the adjoint of  is an automorphism
satisfying (19.9). For the converse, suppose that d is an automorphism of < .
Since d is surjective, there is a unique series  ²!³ for which d  ²!³ ~ !.
Moreover, Theorem 19.18 implies that  ²!³ is a delta series. Thus,
[Á ~ º!  % » ~ ºd  ²!³  % » ~ º ²!³  % »
which shows that % is the associated sequence for  ²!³ and hence that  is an
umbral operator.
Theorem 19.19 allows us to fill in one of the boxes on the right side of Figure
19.1. Let us see how we might use Theorem 19.19 to advantage in the study of
associated sequences.
We have seen that the isomorphism  ª d maps the set K of umbral operators
on F onto the set aut²< ³ of automorphisms of < ~ F i . But aut²< ³ is a group
under composition. So if
 ¢ % ¦  ²%³ and  ¢ % ¦  ²%³
are umbral operators, then since
² k  ³d ~ d k d
is an automorphism of < , it follows that the composition  k  is an umbral
operator. In fact, since
² k  ³d  ²²!³³ ~ d k d  ²²!³³ ~ d  ²!³ ~ !
we deduce that  k  ~  k . Also, since
 k  ~  k ~ ! ~ 
we have c ~  .
Thus, the set K of umbral operators is a group under composition with
 k  ~  k
and
c ~ 
Let us see how this plays out with respect to associated sequences. If the



then  ¢ % ¦  ²%³ and so  k ~  k  is the umbral operator for the

is called the umbral composition of  ²%³ with  ²%³. The umbral operator
 ~ c is the umbral operator for the associated sequence  ²%³ ~ 'Á %
where

Let us summarize.
Theorem 19.20
1) The set K of umbral operators on F is a group under composition, with
 k  ~  k

and

c ~ 

2) The set of associated sequences forms a group under umbral composition

In particular, the umbral composition  ² ²%³³ is the associated sequence

 k ¢ % ¦  ² ²%³³
The identity is the sequence % and the inverse of  ²%³ is the associated
sequence for the compositional inverse  ²!³.

which gives the desired result. Part 4) follows immediately from part 3) since 
is composition by  .

Sheffer Operators
If

 ²%³ is Sheffer for ²Á  ³, then the linear operator Á defined by

Á ²% ³ ~

is called a Sheffer operator. Sheffer operators are closely related to umbral
operators, since if  ²%³ is associated with  ²!³, then
 ²%³ ~ 

c

and so
Á ~ c ²!³
It follows that the Sheffer operators form a group with composition

From this, we deduce that the umbral composition of Sheffer sequences is a

Let us pause for a definition.
Definition Let 7 be an algebra. A linear operator C on 7 is a derivation if
C²³ ~ ²C³ b Cb
for all Á   7.
Thus, we have shown that the adjoint of an umbral shift is a derivation of the
umbral algebra < . Moreover, the expansion theorem and (19.11) show that d
is surjective. This characterizes umbral shifts. First we need a preliminary result
on surjective derivations.

500

Advanced Linear Algebra

Theorem 19.21 Let C be a surjective derivation on the umbral algebra < . Then
C c ~  for any constant   < and ²C f²!³³ ~ ² ²!³³ c , if ² ²!³³  . In
particular, C is continuous.
Proof. We begin by noting that
C ~ C ~ C b C ~ C
and so C ~ C ~  for all constants   < . Since C is surjective, there must
exist an ²!³  < for which
C²!³ ~ 
Writing ²!³ ~  b ! ²!³, we have
 ~ C´ b ! ²!³µ ~ ²C!³ ²!³ b !C ²!³
which implies that ²C!³ ~ . Finally, if ²²!³³ ~   , then ²!³ ~ !  ²!³,
where ² ²!³³ ~  and so
´C²!³µ ~ ´C!  ²!³µ ~ ´! C²!³ b !c ²!³C!µ ~  c 
Theorem 19.22 A linear operator on F is an umbral shift if and only if its
adjoint is a surjective derivation of the umbral algebra < . Moreover, if  is an
umbral shift, then d ~ C is derivation with respect to  ²!³, that is,
d

c
  ²!³ ~  ²!³

for all   . In particular, d  ²!³ ~ .
Proof. We have already seen that d is derivation with respect to  ²!³. For the
converse, suppose that d is a surjective derivation. Theorem 19.21 implies that
there is a delta functional  ²!³ such that d  ²!³ ~ . If  ²%³ is the associated
sequence for  ²!³, then
º ²!³   ²%³» ~ º d  ²!³  ²%³»

Hence,  ²%³ ~ b ²%³, that is,

~

 is the umbral shift for  ²%³.

We have seen that the fact that the set of all automorphisms on < is a group
under composition shows that the set of all associated sequences is a group
under umbral composition. The set of all surjective derivations on < does not
form a group. However, we do have the chain rule for derivations[

The Umbral Calculus

501

Theorem 19.23 (The chain rule) Let C and C be surjective derivations on < .
Then
C ~ ²C  ²!³³C
Proof. This follows from
C  ²!³ ~  ²!³c C  ²!³ ~ ²C  ²!³³C  ²!³
and so continuity implies the result.
The chain rule leads to the following umbral result.
Theorem 19.24 If

 and

 are umbral shifts, then
 ~

 k C  ²!³

Proof. Taking adjoints in the chain rule gives
 ~

 k ²C  ²!³³

d

~

 k C  ²!³

We leave it as an exercise to show that C  ²!³ ~ ´C ²!³µc . Now, by taking

multiplication by %, we get
 ~ %C ! ~ %´C!  ²!³µ

c

~ %´ Z ²!³µc

Applying this to the associated sequence  ²%³ for  ²!³ gives the following
important recurrence relation for  ²%³.
Theorem 19.25 (The recurrence formula) Let  ²%³ be the associated
sequence for  ²!³. Then
1) b ²%³ ~ %´ Z ²!³µc  ²%³
2) b ²%³ ~ % ´ ²!³µZ %
Proof. The first part is proved. As to the second, using Theorem 19.20 we have

~ %´ Z ²!³µc  %
~ % ´ Z ² ²!³³µc %
~ % ´ ²!³µZ %
Example 19.9 The recurrence relation can be used to find the associated
sequence for the forward difference functional  ²!³ ~ ! c . Since  Z ²!³ ~ ! ,
the recurrence relation is
b ²%³ ~ %c!  ²%³ ~ % ²% c 1)

502

Advanced Linear Algebra

Using the fact that  ²%³ ~ , we have
 ²%³ ~ %Á  ²%³ ~ %²% c ³Á 3 ²%³ ~ %²% c ³²% c ³
and so on, leading easily to the lower factorial polynomials
 ²%³ ~ %²% c ³Ä²% c  b ³ ~ ²%³
Example 19.10 Consider the delta functional
 ²!³ ~ log² b !³
Since  ²!³ ~ ! c  is the forward difference functional, Theorem 19.20 implies
that the associated sequence  ²%³ for  ²!³ is the inverse, under umbral
composition, of the lower factorial polynomials. Thus, if we write


 ²%³ ~  :²Á ³%
~

then


% ~ :²Á ³²%³
~

The coefficients :²Á ³ in this equation are known as the Stirling numbers of
the second kind and have great combinatorial significance. In fact, :²Á ³ is
the number of partitions of a set of size  into  blocks. The polynomials  ²%³
are called the exponential polynomials.
The recurrence relation for the exponential polynomials is
b ²%³ ~ %² b !³ ²%³ ~ %² ²%³ b Z ²%³³
Equating coefficients of % on both sides of this gives the well-known formula
for the Stirling numbers
:² b Á ³ ~ :²Á  c ³ b :²Á ³
Many other properties of the Stirling numbers can be derived by umbral
means.
Now we have the analog of part 3) of Theorem 19.20.

from which the result follows.
If  ²!³ ~ !, then  is multiplication by % and
! and so the previous result becomes

 is the derivative with respect to

Z ²!³ ~ ²!³% c %²!³
as operators on F . The right side of this is called the Pincherle derivative of

A Final Remark
Unfortunately, space does not permit a detailed discussion of examples of
Sheffer sequences nor the application of the umbral calculus to various classical
problems. In [105], one can find a discussion of the following polynomial
sequences:
The lower factorial polynomials and Stirling numbers
The exponential polynomials and Dobinski's formula
The Gould polynomials
The central factorial polynomials
The Abel polynomials
The Mittag-Leffler polynomials
The Bessel polynomials
The Bell polynomials
The Hermite polynomials
The Bernoulli polynomials and the Euler–MacLaurin expansion
The Euler polynomials
The Laguerre polynomials
The Bernoulli polynomials of the second kind
The Poisson–Charlier polynomials
The actuarial polynomials
The Meixner polynomials of the first and second kinds
The Pidduck polynomials
The Narumi polynomials
The Boole polynomials
The Peters polynomials
The squared Hermite polynomials
The Stirling polynomials
The Mahler polynomials
The Mott polynomials
and more. In [105], we also find a discussion of how the umbral calculus can be
used to approach the following types of problems:
The connection constants problem
Duplication formulas
The Lagrange inversion formula
Cross sequences
Steffensen sequences
Operational formulas
Inverse relations
Sheffer sequence solutions to recurrence relations
Binomial convolution

Finally, it is possible to generalize the classical umbral calculus that we have
described in this chapter to provide a context for studying polynomial sequences
such as those of the names Gegenbauer, Chebyshev and Jacobi. Also, there is a

known as the Gaussian coefficients)
